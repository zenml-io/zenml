## üö® The Problem: MLOps Works for Models, But What About AI?

![No MLOps for modern AI](docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_problem.png)

You're an ML engineer. You've perfected deploying scikit-learn models and wrangling TensorFlow jobs. Your MLOps stack is dialed in. But now, you're being asked to build and ship AI agents, and suddenly your trusted toolkit is starting to crack.

- **The Adaptation Struggle:** Your MLOps habits‚Äîrigorous testing, versioning, CI/CD‚Äîdon‚Äôt map cleanly onto agent development. How do you version a prompt? How do you regression test a non-deterministic system? The tools that gave you confidence for models now create friction for agents.

- **The Divided Stack:** To cope, teams are building a second, parallel stack just for LLM-based systems. Now you‚Äôre maintaining two sets of tools, two deployment pipelines, and two mental models. Your classical models live in one world, your agents in another. It's expensive, complex, and slows everyone down.

- **The Broken Feedback Loop:** Getting an agent from your local environment to production is a slow, painful journey. By the time you get feedback on performance, cost, or quality, the requirements have already changed. Iteration is a guessing game, not a data-driven process.

## üí° The Solution: One Framework for your Entire AI Stack

Stop maintaining two separate worlds. ZenML is a unified MLOps framework that extends the battle-tested principles you rely on for classical ML to the new world of AI agents. It‚Äôs one platform to develop, evaluate, and deploy your entire AI portfolio.

```python
# Morning: Your sklearn pipeline is still versioned and reproducible.
train_and_deploy_classifier()

# Afternoon: Your new agent evaluation pipeline uses the same logic.
evaluate_and_deploy_agent()

# Same platform. Same principles. New possibilities.
```

With ZenML, you're not replacing your knowledge; you're extending it. Use the pipelines and practices you already know to version, test, deploy, and monitor everything from classic models to the most advanced agents.

## üíª See It In Action: Multi-Agent Architecture Comparison

**The Challenge:** Your team built three different customer service agents. Which one should go to production? With ZenML, you can build a reproducible pipeline to test them on real data and make a data-driven decision.

```python
from zenml import pipeline, step
import pandas as pd

@step
def load_real_conversations() -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load actual customer queries from a feature store."""
    return load_from_feature_store("customer_queries_sample_1k")

@step
def run_architecture_comparison(queries: pd.DataFrame) -> dict:
    """Test three different agent architectures on the same data."""
    architectures = {
        "single_agent": SingleAgentRAG(),
        "multi_specialist": MultiSpecialistAgents(),
        "hierarchical": HierarchicalAgentTeam()
    }
    
    results = {}
    for name, agent in architectures.items():
        # ZenML automatically versions the agent's code, prompts, and tools
        results[name] = agent.batch_process(queries)
    return results

@step
def evaluate_and_decide(results: dict) -> str:
    """Evaluate results and generate a recommendation report."""
    # Compare architectures on quality, cost, latency, etc.
    evaluation_df = evaluate_results(results)
    
    # Generate a rich report comparing the architectures
    report = create_comparison_report(evaluation_df)
    
    # Automatically tag the winning architecture for a staging deployment
    winner = evaluation_df.sort_values("overall_score").iloc[0]
    tag_for_staging(winner["architecture_name"])
    
    return report

@pipeline
def compare_agent_architectures():
    """Your new Friday afternoon ritual: data-driven agent decisions."""
    queries = load_real_conversations()
    results = run_architecture_comparison(queries)
    report = evaluate_and_decide(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run locally, compare results in the ZenML dashboard
    compare_agent_architectures()
```

**The Result:** A clear winner is selected based on data, not opinions. You have full lineage from the test data and agent versions to the final report and deployment decision.

## üîÑ The AI Development Lifecycle with ZenML

### From Chaos to Process

![Development lifecycle](docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_development_lifecycle.png)

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to see your new, structured workflow</b></summary>

### Your New Workflow

**Monday: Quick Prototype**
```python
# Start with a local script, just like always
agent = LangGraphAgent(prompt="You are a helpful assistant...")
response = agent.chat("Help me with my order")
```

**Tuesday: Make it a Pipeline**
```python
# Wrap your code in a ZenML step to make it reproducible
@step
def customer_service_agent(query: str) -> str:
    return agent.chat(query)
```

**Wednesday: Add Evaluation**
```python
# Test on real data, not toy examples
@pipeline
def eval_pipeline():
    test_data = load_production_samples()
    responses = customer_service_agent.map(test_data)
    scores = evaluate_responses(responses)
    track_experiment(scores)
```

**Thursday: Compare Architectures**
```python
# Make data-driven architecture decisions
results = compare_architectures(
    baseline="current_prod",
    challenger="new_multiagent_v2"
)
```

**Friday: Ship with Confidence**
```python
# Deploy the new agent with the same command you use for ML models
zenml stack deploy agent-prod --model="customer_service:challenger"
```

## ‚ùì FAQs from ML Engineers Like You

**Q: "Do I need to rewrite my agents or models to use ZenML?"**
A: No. Wrap your existing code in a `@step`. Keep using Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or raw API calls. ZenML orchestrates your tools, it doesn't replace them.

**Q: "How is this different from LangSmith/Langfuse?"**
A: They provide excellent observability for LLM applications. We orchestrate the **full MLOps lifecycle for your entire AI stack**. With ZenML, you manage both your classical ML models and your AI agents in one unified framework, from development and evaluation all the way to production deployment.

**Q: "Can I use my existing MLflow/W&B setup?"**
A: Yes! We integrate with both. Your experiments, our pipelines.

**Q: "Is this just MLflow with extra steps?"**
A: No. MLflow tracks experiments. We orchestrate the entire development process ‚Äì from training and evaluation to deployment and monitoring ‚Äì for both models and agents.

**Q: "What about cost? I can't afford another platform."**
A: ZenML's open-source version is free forever. You likely already have the required infrastructure (like a Kubernetes cluster and object storage). We just help you make better use of it for MLOps.
