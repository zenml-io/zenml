Thank you for your support! üåü

## ü§∏ Quickstart
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb)

[Install ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation) via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/). Python 3.9 - 3.12 is required:

```bash
pip install "zenml[server]" notebook
```

Take a tour with the guided quickstart by running:

```bash
zenml go
```

## ü™Ñ Simple, integrated, End-to-end MLOps 

### Create machine learning pipelines with minimal code changes

ZenML is a MLOps framework intended for data scientists or ML engineers looking to standardize machine learning practices. Just add `@step` and `@pipeline` to your existing Python functions to get going. Here is a toy example:

```python
from zenml import pipeline, step

@step  # Just add this decorator
def load_data() -> dict:
    training_data = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
    labels = [0, 1, 0]
    return {'features': training_data, 'labels': labels}

@step
def train_model(data: dict) -> None:
    total_features = sum(map(sum, data['features']))
    total_labels = sum(data['labels'])
    
    print(f"Trained model using {len(data['features'])} data points. "
          f"Feature sum is {total_features}, label sum is {total_labels}")

@pipeline  # This function combines steps together 
def simple_ml_pipeline():
    dataset = load_data()
    train_model(dataset)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run = simple_ml_pipeline()  # call this to run the pipeline
   
```

![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_basic_pipeline.gif)

### Easily provision an MLOps stack or reuse your existing infrastructure

The framework is a gentle entry point for practitioners to build complex ML pipelines with little knowledge required of the underlying infrastructure complexity. ZenML pipelines can be run on AWS, GCP, Azure, Airflow, Kubeflow and even on Kubernetes without having to change any code or know underlying internals. 

ZenML provides different features to aid people to get started quickly on a remote setting as well. If you want to deploy a remote stack from scratch on your selected cloud provider, you can use the 1-click deployment feature either through the dashboard:

![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/one-click-deployment.gif)

Or, through our CLI command:

```bash
zenml stack deploy --provider aws
```

Alternatively, if the necessary pieces of infrastructure are already deployed, you can register a cloud stack seamlessly through the stack wizard:

```bash
zenml stack register <STACK_NAME> --provider aws
```

Read more about [ZenML stacks](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/understand-stacks).

### Run workloads easily on your production infrastructure

Once you have your MLOps stack configured, you can easily run workloads on it:

```bash
zenml stack set <STACK_NAME>
python run.py
```

```python
from zenml.config import ResourceSettings, DockerSettings

@step(
  settings={
    "resources": ResourceSettings(memory="16GB", gpu_count="1", cpu_count="8"),
    "docker": DockerSettings(parent_image="pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime")
  }
)
def training(...):
	...
```

![Workloads with ZenML](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_compute.gif)

### Track models, pipeline, and artifacts

Create a complete lineage of who, where, and what data and models are produced.

You‚Äôll be able to find out who produced which model, at what time, with which data, and on which version of the code. This guarantees full reproducibility and auditability.

```python
from zenml import Model

@step(model=Model(name="classification"))
def trainer(training_df: pd.DataFrame) -> Annotated["model", torch.nn.Module]:
	...
```

![Exploring ZenML Models](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_mcp.gif)

### Purpose built for machine learning with integrations to your favorite tools

While ZenML brings a lot of value out of the box, it also integrates into your existing tooling and infrastructure without you having to be locked in.

```python
from bentoml._internal.bento import bento

@step(on_failure=alert_slack, experiment_tracker="mlflow")
def train_and_deploy(training_df: pd.DataFrame) -> bento.Bento
	mlflow.autolog()
	...
	return bento
```

## üñºÔ∏è Learning

The best way to learn about ZenML is the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/). We recommend beginning with the [Starter Guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) to get up and running quickly.

If you are a visual learner, this 11-minute video tutorial is also a great start:

## üîã Deploy ZenML

For full functionality ZenML should be deployed on the cloud to
enable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.

Read more about various deployment options [here](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml).
