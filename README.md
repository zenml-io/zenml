## ‚≠êÔ∏è Show Your Support

If you find ZenML helpful or interesting, please consider giving us a star on GitHub. Your support helps promote the project and lets others know that it's worth checking out.

Thank you for your support! üåü

[![Star this project](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zenml-io/zenml?style=social)](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/stargazers)

## ü§∏ Quickstart
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb)

[Install ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation) via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/). Python 3.9 - 3.12 is required:

```bash
pip install "zenml[server]" notebook
```

Take a tour with the guided quickstart by running:

```bash
zenml go
```

## üéØ The Hidden Complexity of Production AI

You've built a great POC with LangGraph. Your RAG demo works perfectly. But now you need to:

- **Run evaluation pipelines** on every update
- **Process documents in batch** workflows
- **Track costs** across 5 different LLM providers
- **Prove compliance** for EU AI Act requirements
- **Unify observability** across LangFuse, LiteLLM, and other custom tools

**ZenML is the orchestration layer that connects it all** - without replacing
any of your existing tools.

## üë• Who Should Use ZenML?

**Perfect for:**
- Platform teams drowning in LLM tool sprawl
- Enterprises running batch agent workflows (document processing, evals)
- Teams facing regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, healthcare, finance),
  especially those in high-risk categories (e.g. healthcare, finance)
- Organizations that need self-hosted/hybrid solutions with vendor support

**Not for:**
- Real-time agent serving (we currently work best with batch/scheduled workflows)
- Replacing your agent framework (we orchestrate, not execute)
- Generic CI/CD (we're purpose-built for AI/ML)

## What does ZenML add to your stack?

### Stack-agnostic: keep your code the same

- write your code once, run it anywhere
- build around your application logic, not around your infrastructure

### Built for platform teams

- don‚Äôt build your own platform, just use zenml
- we handle all the boring stuff, you just focus on what adds value
- we've built zenml based on the needs of our customers, so you can benefit from
  the collective experience of the community

### We track and version everything

- prompts, artifacts (input and output of any steps in a zenml pipeline),
  models, metadata, config and parameters used to invoke or trigger a pipeline,
  github SHA, logs, visualizations and any extra custom metadata you want to
  track like cost, latency etc.
- this all happens automatically
- (you'll need this for EU AI Act compliance)
- access everything programmatically via the ZenML SDK (or chat with your data using the ZenML MCP server)

### Supports MLOps as well as LLMOps

- ZenML has been around for a while so we're battle-tested in the MLOps space
- we've grown and built features around the LLMOps space too as this has slowly
  become more of a thing.
- super solid for MLOps, and this is a great foundation for LLMOps
- strong overlap between the needs of the two and many of our customers started
  out with MLOps and have now added or incorporated LLMOps into their workflows.

## Features

### Manage tool sprawl: Don't Replace - Supercharge

- One dashboard to rule them all.
- Keep using the same tools you know and love, but let ZenML give you more control and observability.
- Integrate with your favourite frameworks and libraries‚ÄîZenML sits on top, providing a unified view across your stack.
- Centralise experiment tracking, model registry, and pipeline orchestration without forcing you to migrate or refactor your existing workflows.
- Gain visibility into every step, from data ingestion to deployment, with detailed lineage and audit trails.
- Reduce context switching and manual handoffs by connecting disparate tools and teams through a single platform.

### Supports common use cases and workflows

- Traditional ML pipelines
- RAG pipelines
- Batch agentic workflows
- Agent deployment
- Evaluation pipelines
- EU AI Act compliance

### üèóÔ∏è A Bridge Between Data Science and Platform Teams

**For Data Scientists**: Visual dashboards, one-click deployments, no YAML files
**For Platform Teams**: RBAC / access controls, audit logs, self-hosted, custom integrations


## üñºÔ∏è Learning

The best way to learn about ZenML is the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/). We recommend beginning with the [Starter Guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) to get up and running quickly.

If you are a visual learner, this 11-minute video tutorial is also a great start:

[![Introductory Youtube Video](docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_youtube_thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEVwIkDvUPs)

And finally, here are some other examples and use cases for inspiration:

1. [E2E Batch Inference](examples/e2e/): Feature engineering, training, and inference pipelines for tabular machine learning.
2. [Basic NLP with BERT](examples/e2e_nlp/): Feature engineering, training, and inference focused on NLP.
3. [LLM RAG Pipeline with Langchain and OpenAI](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/zenml-support-agent): Using Langchain to create a simple RAG pipeline.
4. [Huggingface Model to Sagemaker Endpoint](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/huggingface-sagemaker): Automated MLOps on Amazon Sagemaker and HuggingFace
5. [LLMops](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/llm-complete-guide): Complete guide to do LLM with ZenML

## üìö LLM-focused Learning Resources

1. [LL Complete Guide - Full RAG Pipeline](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/llm-complete-guide) - Document ingestion, embedding management, and query serving
2. [LLM Fine-Tuning Pipeline](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/zencoder) - From data prep to deployed model
3. [LLM Agents Example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/zenml-support-agent) - Track conversation quality and tool usage

## üîã Deploy ZenML

For full functionality ZenML should be deployed on the cloud to
enable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.

Read more about various deployment options [here](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml).

Or, sign up for [ZenML Pro to get a fully managed server on a free trial](https://cloud.zenml.io/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=referral_link&utm_campaign=cloud_promotion&utm_content=signup_link).

## Use ZenML with VS Code

ZenML has a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZenML.zenml-vscode) that allows you to inspect your stacks and pipeline runs directly from your editor. The extension also allows you to switch your stacks without needing to type any CLI commands.

## ü§ñ AI-Friendly Documentation with llms.txt

ZenML implements the llms.txt standard to make our documentation more accessible to AI assistants and LLMs. Our implementation includes:

- Base documentation at [zenml.io/llms.txt](https://zenml.io/llms.txt) with core user guides
- Specialized files for different documentation aspects:
  - [Component guides](https://zenml.io/component-guide.txt) for integration details
  - [How-to guides](https://zenml.io/how-to-guides.txt) for practical implementations
  - [Complete documentation corpus](https://zenml.io/llms-full.txt) for comprehensive access

This structured approach helps AI tools better understand and utilize ZenML's documentation, enabling more accurate code suggestions and improved documentation search.
