## ü§∏ Quickstart
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb)

[Install ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation) via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/). Python 3.9 - 3.12 is required:

```bash
pip install "zenml[server]" notebook
```

Take a tour with the guided quickstart by running:

```bash
zenml go
```

## ü™Ñ From Prototype to Production: AI Made Simple

### Create AI pipelines with minimal code changes

ZenML is an open-source framework that handles MLOps and LLMOps for engineers scaling AI beyond prototypes. Automate evaluation loops, track performance, and deploy updates across 100s of pipelines‚Äîall while your RAG apps run like clockwork.

```python
from zenml import pipeline, step

@step
def load_rag_documents() -> dict:
    # Load and chunk documents for RAG pipeline
    documents = extract_web_content(url="https://www.zenml.io/")
    return {"chunks": chunk_documents(documents)}

@step
def generate_embeddings(data: dict) -> None:
    # Generate embeddings for RAG pipeline
    embeddings = embed_documents(data['chunks'])
    return {"embeddings": embeddings}

@step
def index_generator(
    embeddings: dict,
) -> str:
    # Generate index for RAG pipeline
    index = create_index(embeddings)
    return index.id
    

@pipeline
def rag_pipeline() -> str:
    documents = load_rag_documents()
    embeddings = generate_embeddings(documents)
    index = index_generator(embeddings)
    return index
```
![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_simple_pipeline.gif)

### Easily provision an MLOps stack or reuse your existing infrastructure

The framework is a gentle entry point for practitioners to build complex ML pipelines with little knowledge required of the underlying infrastructure complexity. ZenML pipelines can be run on AWS, GCP, Azure, Airflow, Kubeflow and even on Kubernetes without having to change any code or know underlying internals. 

ZenML provides different features to aid people to get started quickly on a remote setting as well. If you want to deploy a remote stack from scratch on your selected cloud provider, you can use the 1-click deployment feature either through the dashboard:

![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/one-click-deployment.gif)

Or, through our CLI command:

```bash
zenml stack deploy --provider aws
```

Alternatively, if the necessary pieces of infrastructure are already deployed, you can register a cloud stack seamlessly through the stack wizard:

```bash
zenml stack register <STACK_NAME> --provider aws
```

Read more about [ZenML stacks](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/understand-stacks).

### Run workloads easily on your production infrastructure

Once you have your MLOps stack configured, you can easily run workloads on it:

```bash
zenml stack set <STACK_NAME>
python run.py
```

```python
from zenml.config import ResourceSettings, DockerSettings

@step(
  settings={
    "resources": ResourceSettings(memory="16GB", gpu_count="1", cpu_count="8"),
    "docker": DockerSettings(parent_image="pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime")
  }
)
def training(...):
	...
```

![Workloads with ZenML](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_compute.gif)

### Track models, pipeline, and artifacts

Create a complete lineage of who, where, and what data and models are produced.

You'll be able to find out who produced which model, at what time, with which data, and on which version of the code. This guarantees full reproducibility and auditability.

```python
from zenml import Model

@step(model=Model(name="rag_llm", tags=["staging"]))
def deploy_rag(index_id: str) -> str:
    deployment_id = deploy_to_endpoint(index_id)
    return deployment_id
```

![Exploring ZenML Models](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_mcp.gif)

## üöÄ Key LLMOps Capabilities

### Continual RAG Improvement
**Build production-ready retrieval systems**  

<div align="center">
  <img src="/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/rag_zenml_home.png" width="800" alt="RAG Pipeline">
</div>

ZenML tracks document ingestion, embedding versions, and query patterns. Implement feedback loops and:
- Fix your RAG logic based on production logs
- Automatically re-ingest updated documents
- A/B test different embedding models
- Monitor retrieval quality metrics

### Reproducible Model Fine-Tuning
**Confidence in model updates**

<div align="center">
  <img src="/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/finetune_zenml_home.png" width="800" alt="Finetuning Pipeline">
</div>

Maintain full lineage of SLM/LLM training runs:
- Version training data and hyperparameters
- Track performance across iterations
- Automatically promote validated models
- Roll back to previous versions if needed

### Purpose built for machine learning with integrations to your favorite tools

While ZenML brings a lot of value out of the box, it also integrates into your existing tooling and infrastructure without you having to be locked in.

```python
from bentoml._internal.bento import bento

@step(on_failure=alert_slack, experiment_tracker="mlflow")
def train_and_deploy(training_df: pd.DataFrame) -> bento.Bento
	mlflow.autolog()
	...
	return bento
```

![Exploring ZenML Integrations](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_integrations.gif)

## üîÑ Your LLM Framework Isn't Enough for Production

While tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex help you **build** LLM workflows, ZenML helps you **productionize** them by adding:

‚úÖ **Artifact Tracking** - Every vector store index, fine-tuned model, and evaluation result versioned automatically  
‚úÖ **Pipeline History** - See exactly what code/data produced each version of your RAG system  
‚úÖ **Stage Promotion** - Move validated pipelines from staging ‚Üí production with one click  

## üñºÔ∏è Learning

The best way to learn about ZenML is the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/). We recommend beginning with the [Starter Guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) to get up and running quickly.

If you are a visual learner, this 11-minute video tutorial is also a great start:
