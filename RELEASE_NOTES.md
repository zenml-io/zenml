**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.70.0...0.71.0

# 0.70.0

The **ZenML 0.70.0** release includes a significant number of database schema changes and migrations, which means upgrading to this version will require extra caution. As always, please make sure to make a copy of your production database before upgrading.

## Key Changes

* **Artifact Versioning Improvements**: The handling of artifact versions has been improved, including the API improvements like the ability to batch artifact version requests to improve the execution times and more types for the step input/output artifacts, including multiple versions of the same artifact (e.g. model checkpoints), to improve the UX using ZenML UI or while working directly with the API.
* **Scalability Enhancements**: Various scalability improvements have been made, such as reducing unnecessary server requests and incrementing artifact versions server-side. These enhancements are expected to provide significant speed and scale improvements for ZenML users.
* **Metadata management**: Now, all the metadata-creating functions are gathered under one method called `log_metadata`. It is possible to call this method with different inputs to log run metadata for artifact versions, model versions, steps, and runs.
* **The oneof filtering**: This allows to filter entities using a new operator called `oneof`. You can use this with IDs (UUID type) or tags (or other string-typed attributes) like this `PipelineRunFilter(tag='oneof:["cats", "dogs"]')`.
* **Documentation Improvements**: The ZenML documentation has been restructured and expanded, including the addition of new sections on [finetuning](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/llmops-guide/finetuning-llms) and [LLM/ML engineering](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/llmops-guide/evaluation) resources.
* **Bug Fixes**: This release includes several bug fixes, including issues with in-process main module source loading, and more.

## Caution: Make sure to back up your data before upgrading!
While this release brings many valuable improvements, the database schema changes and migrations pose a potential risk to users. It is strongly recommended that users:

* **Test the upgrade on a non-production environment**: Before upgrading a production system, test the upgrade process in a non-production environment to identify and address any issues.
* **Back up your data**: Ensure that you have a reliable backup of your ZenML data before attempting the upgrade.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.66.0...0.67.0

# 0.66.0

## New Features and Improvements

### Python 3.12 support

This release adds support for Python 3.12, which means you can now develop your ZenML pipelines
with the latest python features.

### Easier way to specify component settings

Before this release, settings for stack components had to be specified with both the component type
as well as the flavor. We simplified this and it is now possible to specify settings just using the
component type:
```python
# Before
@pipeline(settings={"orchestrator.sagemaker": SagemakerOrchestratorSettings(...)})
def my_pipeline():
  ...

# Now
@pipeline(settings={"orchestrator": SagemakerOrchestratorSettings(...)})
def my_pipeline():
  ...
```

## Breaking changes

* In order to slim down the ZenML library, we removed the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries as dependencies of ZenML. If your
code uses these libraries, you have to make sure they're installed in your local environment as well as the Docker images that
get built to run your pipelines (Use `DockerSettings.requirements` or `DockerSettings.required_integrations`).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.65.0...0.66.0

# 0.65.0

## New Features and Improvements

### New Quickstart Experience

This example demonstrates how ZenML streamlines the transition of machine learning workflows from local environments to 
cloud-scale operations.

### Run Single Step as a ZenML Pipeline

If you want to run just an individual step on your stack, you can simply call the step
as you would with a normal Python function. ZenML will internally create a pipeline with just your step
and run it on the active stack.

### Other improvements and fixes

* Updated AzureML Step Operator to work with SDKv2 and use Service Connectors
* Added timestamps to log messages
* Fixed issue with loading artifacts from artifact store outside of current active artifact store
* Support of templated names for Model Version (`{date}` and `{time}` are currently supported placeholders)
* `run_with_accelerate` step wrapper can be used as a Python Decorator on top of ZenML steps

## Breaking changes

* Workspace scoped POST endpoint `full-stack` was removed and merged with `stacks` POST endpoint

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.64.0...0.65.0

# 0.64.0

## New Features and Improvements

### Notebook Integration

ZenML now supports running steps defined in notebook cells with remote 
orchestrators and step operators. This feature enhances the development 
workflow by allowing seamless transition from experimentation to production.

- **Details**: [Running remote pipelines from notebooks](https://docs.zenml.io/v/docs/how-to/run-remote-pipelines-from-notebooks)

### Reduced Docker Builds with Code Uploads

We've introduced an option to upload code to the artifact store, enabling 
Docker build reuse. This feature can significantly speed up iteration, 
especially when working with remote stacks.

- **Default**: Enabled
- **Configuration**: To disable, set `DockerSettings.allow_download_from_artifact_store=False` 
for steps or pipelines
- **Benefits**: 
  - Faster development cycles
  - No need to register a code repository to reuse builds
  - Builds only occur when requirements or DockerSettings change
- **Documentation**: [Which files are built into the image](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/customize-docker-builds/which-files-are-built-into-the-image)

### AzureML Orchestrator Support

ZenML now supports [AzureML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/machine-learning) 
as an orchestrator, expanding our list of supported cloud platforms.

- **Full Azure Guide**: [Setting up an Azure stack](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/popular-integrations/azure-guide)
- **Documentation**: [AzureML orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/azureml)

### Terraform Modules

We've released new Terraform modules on the Hashicorp registry for 
provisioning complete MLOps stacks across major cloud providers.

- **Features**: 
  - Automate infrastructure setup for ZenML stack deployment
  - Handle registration of configurations to ZenML server
- **More Information**: [MLOps Terraform ZenML blog post](https://www.zenml.io/blog/mlops-terraform-zenml)

These updates aim to streamline the MLOps workflow, making it easier to 
develop, deploy, and manage machine learning pipelines with ZenML.

We'd like to give a special thanks to @christianversloot who contributed to 
this release by bumping the `mlflow` version to 2.15.0

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.63.0...0.64.0

# 0.63.0

Moving forward from the last two releases, we have further improved the 
1-click deployment tool and the stack wizard by adding support for Azure.

Moreover, we implemented a new step operator that allows you to run individual

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.62.0...0.63.0

# 0.62.0

Building on top of the last release, this release adds a new and easy way to deploy a GCP ZenML stack from the dashboard and the CLI. Give it a try by going to the `Stacks` section in the dashboard or running the `zenml stack deploy` command! For more information on this new feature, please do check out [the video and blog](https://www.zenml.io/blog/easy-mlops-pipelines) from our previous release.

We also [updated our Hugging Face integration](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2851) to support the automatic display of an embedded `datasets` preview pane in the ZenML Dashboard whenever you return a `Dataset` from a step. This was recently released by the Hugging Face datasets team and it allows you to easily visualize and inspect your data from the comfort of the dashboard.

# 0.61.0

This release comes with a new and easy way to deploy an AWS ZenML stack from the dashboard and the CLI. Give it a try by going to the `Stacks` section in the dashboard or running the `zenml stack deploy` command!

We hope this makes it super easy for existing and new users to set up the infrastructure required to run ZenML pipelines on the cloud in one click.

Note: Only a simple AWS stack using Skypilot supported for now but GCP + Azure to come!

Additionally, this release includes improvements to our documentation and bugfixes for some integrations.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.60.0...0.61.0

# 0.60.0

ZenML now uses Pydantic v2. 🥳

This upgrade comes with a set of critical updates. While your user experience
mostly remains unaffected, you might see unexpected behavior due to the
changes in our dependencies. Moreover, since Pydantic v2 provides a slightly
stricter validation process, you might end up bumping into some validation
errors which was not caught before, but it is all for the better 🙂 If
you run into any other errors, please let us know either on
[GitHub](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml) or on
our [Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite).

## Changes in some of the critical dependencies

- SQLModel is one of the core dependencies of ZenML and prior to this upgrade,
  we were utilizing version `0.0.8`. However, this version is relatively
  outdated and incompatible with Pydantic v2. Within the scope of this upgrade,
  we upgraded it to `0.0.18`.
- Due to the change in the SQLModel version, we also had to upgrade our
  SQLAlchemy dependency from V1 to v2. While this does not affect the way
  that you are using ZenML, if you are using SQLAlchemy in your environment,
  you might have to migrate your code as well. For a detailed list of changes,
  feel free to
  check [their migration guide](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_20.html).

## Changes in `pydantic`

Pydantic v2 brings a lot of new and exciting changes to the table. The core
logic now uses Rust, and it is much faster and more efficient in terms of
performance. On top of it, the main concepts like model design, configuration,
validation, or serialization now include a lot of new cool features. If you are
using `pydantic` in your workflow and are interested in the new changes, you can
check [the brilliant migration guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.7/migration/)
provided by the `pydantic` team to see the full list of changes.

## Changes in our integrations changes

Much like ZenML, `pydantic` is an important dependency in many other Python
packages. That’s why conducting this upgrade helped us unlock a new version for
several ZenML integration dependencies. Additionally, in some instances, we had
to adapt the functionality of the integration to keep it compatible
with `pydantic`. So, if you are using any of these integrations, please go
through the changes.

### Airflow

As mentioned above upgrading our `pydantic` dependency meant we had to upgrade
our `sqlmodel` dependency. Upgrading our `sqlmodel` dependency meant we had to
upgrade our `sqlalchemy` dependency as well. Unfortunately, `apache-airflow`
is still using `sqlalchemy` v1 and is incompatible with pydantic v2. As a
solution, we have removed the dependencies of the `airflow` integration. Now,
you can use ZenML to create your Airflow pipelines and use a separate
environment to run them with Airflow. You can check the updated docs
[right here](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/airflow).

### AWS

Some of our integrations now require `protobuf` 4. Since our
previous `sagemaker` version (`2.117.0`) did not support `protobof` 4, we could
not pair it with these new integrations. Thankfully `sagemaker` started
supporting `protobuf` 4 with version `2.172.0` and relaxing its dependency
solved the compatibility issue.

### Evidently

The old version of our `evidently` integration was not compatible with Pydantic
v2. They started supporting it starting from version `0.4.16`. As their latest
version is `0.4.22`, the new dependency of the integration is limited between
these two versions.

### Feast

Our previous implementation of the `feast` integration was not compatible with
Pydantic v2 due to the extra `redis` dependency we were using. This extra
dependency is now removed and the `feast` integration is working as intended.

### GCP

The previous version of the Kubeflow dependency (`kfp==1.8.22`) in our GCP
integration required Pydantic V1 to be installed. While we were upgrading our
Pydantic dependency, we saw this as an opportunity and wanted to use this chance
to upgrade the `kfp` dependency to v2 (which has no dependencies on the Pydantic
library). This is why you may see some functional changes in the vertex step
operator and orchestrator. If you would like to go through the changes in
the `kfp` library, you can
find [the migration guide here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/migration/).

### Great Expectations

Great Expectations started supporting Pydantic v2 starting from
version `0.17.15` and they are closing in on their `1.0` release. Since this
release might include a lot of big changes, we adjusted the dependency in our
integration to `great-expectations>=0.17.15,<1.0`. We will try to keep it
updated in the future once they release the `1.0` version

### Kubeflow

Similar to the GCP integration, the previous version of the kubeflow
dependency (`kfp==1.8.22`) in our `kubeflow` integration required Pydantic V1 to
be installed. While we were upgrading our Pydantic dependency, we saw this as an
opportunity and wanted to use this chance to upgrade the `kfp` dependency to
v2 (which has no dependencies on the Pydantic library). If you would like to go
through the changes in the `kfp` library, you can
find [the migration guide here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/migration/). (
We also are considering adding an alternative version of this integration so our
users can keep using `kfp` V1 in their environment. Stay tuned for any updates.)

### MLflow

`mlflow` is compatible with both Pydantic V1 and v2. However, due to a known
issue, if you install `zenml` first and then
do `zenml integration install mlflow -y`, it downgrades `pydantic` to V1. This
is why we manually added the same duplicated `pydantic` requirement in the
integration definition as well. Keep in mind that the `mlflow` library is still
using some features of `pydantic` V1 which are deprecated. So, if the
integration is installed in your environment, you might run into some
deprecation warnings.

### Label Studio

While we were working on updating our `pydantic` dependency,
the `label-studio-sdk` has released its 1.0 version. In this new
version, `pydantic` v2 is also supported. The implementation and documentation
of our Label Studio integration have been updated accordingly.

### Skypilot

With the switch to `pydantic` v2, the implementation of our `skypilot`
integration mostly remained untouched. However, due to an incompatibility
between the new version `pydantic` and the `azurecli`, the `skypilot[azure]`
flavor can not be installed at the same time, thus our `skypilot_azure`
integration is currently deactivated. We are working on fixing this issue and if
you are using this integration in your workflows, we recommend staying on the
previous version of ZenML until we can solve this issue.

### Tensorflow

The new version of `pydantic` creates a drift between `tensorflow`
and  `typing_extensions`  packages and relaxing the dependencies here resolves
the issue. At the same time, the upgrade to `kfp` v2 (in integrations
like `kubeflow`, `tekton`, or `gcp`) bumps our `protobuf` dependency from `3.X`
to `4.X`. To stay compatible with this requirement, the installed version
of `tensorflow` needs to be `>=2.12.0`. While this change solves the dependency
issues in most settings, we have bumped into some errors while
using `tensorflow` 2.12.0 on Python 3.8 on Ubuntu. If you would like to use this
integration, please consider using a higher Python version.

### Tekton

Similar to the `gcp` and `kubeflow` integrations, the old version of
our `tekton` integration was not compatible with `pydantic` V1 due to its `kfp`
dependency. With the switch from `kfp` V1 to v2, we have adapted our
implementation to use the new version of `kfp` library and updated our
documentation accordingly.

## Additional Changes

* We have also released a new version of `mlstacks` with Pydantic v2 support. 
If you are using it in your development environment, you have to upgrade your 
`mlstacks` package as well.
* Added `zenml.integrations.huggingface.steps.run_with_accelerate` to enable running any step using [`accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/index). This function is supported by a utility that wraps any step function into a CLI script (which is required by most distributed training tools).
* Fixed a memory leak that was observed while using the ZenML dashboard to view pipeline logs or artifact visualizations logged through an S3 Artifact Store linked to an AWS Service Connector.
* Previously, we had an option called `build_options` that allowed users to pass arguments to the docker build command. However, these options were only applied when building the parent image. On macOS with ARM architecture, one needs to specify `platform=linux/amd64` to the build command to leverage local caching of Docker image layers. We have added a way to specify these build options for the "main" ZenML build as well, not just the parent image build. Additionally, users can now specify a `.dockerignore` file for the parent image build, which was previously not possible.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.58.0...0.58.1

# 0.58.0

## New Annotators
This release brings in three new integrations for our annotator stack component: [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), [Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) and [Pigeon](https://github.com/agermanidis/pigeon).
* Pigeon works within Jupyter notebooks and supports a limited feature set but is great for 
experimentation and demos.
* Argilla works both locally-deployed and when the annotation instance lives in the cloud 
(i.e. in the Hugging Face Spaces deployment which they recommend).
* Prodigy is a powerful closed-source annotation tool that allows for efficient data labeling. With this 
integration, users can now connect ZenML with Prodigy and leverage its annotation capabilities 
in their ML pipelines.

## Retry configuration for steps
This release also includes new `retry` configuration for the steps. The following parameters 
can be set:

- _**max_retries**_: The maximum number of times the step should be retried in case of failure.
- _**delay**_: The initial delay in seconds before the first retry attempt.
- _**backoff**_: The factor by which the delay should be multiplied after each retry attempt.

To use this in your code:

```python
from zenml.config.retry_config import StepRetryConfig

@step(retry=StepRetryConfig(max_retries=3, delay=10, backoff=2))
def step_3() -> None:
    # Step implementation
    raise Exception("This is a test exception")
```

or using a `config.yaml`:

```yaml
steps:
  my_step:
    retry:
      max_retries: 3
      delay: 10
      backoff: 2
 ```

In addition, this release includes a number of bug fixes and documentation updates, such
as a new LLM finetuning template powered by PEFT and BitsAndBytes and instructions for the
new annotators.


## Breaking changes
* The interface for the base class of the annotator stack component has been updated to 
account for the fact that not all annotators will launch with a specific URL. So there is 
no longer an url argument passed in.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.57.0...0.57.1

# 0.57.0

We're excited to announce that we're open-sourcing our new and improved dashboard. This unifies the experience for OSS and cloud users, though OSS users will initially see some dashboard features unavailable in this launch release.

We're open-sourcing our dashboard for a few reasons:

- to ensure that the dashboard experience is consistent across all users, for both the open-source and cloud versions
- to make it easier for us to maintain and develop the dashboard, as we can share components between the two versions
- to allow OSS contributions (and self-hosting and modifications) to the new dashboard
- to open up possibilities for future features, particularly for our OSS users

New users of the ZenML in the dashboard will have a better experience thanks to a much-improved onboarding sequence:

<div align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="docs/book/.gitbook/assets/new_dashboard_rn_2.png" alt="Dashboard 2"/>
</div>

The dashboard will guide you through connecting to your server, setting up a stack, connecting to service connectors as well as running a pipeline.

We’ve also improved the ‘Settings’ section of the dashboard and this is the new home for configuration of your repositories, secrets, and connectors, along with some other options.

<div align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="docs/book/.gitbook/assets/new_dashboard_rn_3.png" alt="Dashboard 3"/>
</div>

## What It Means for You

If you're already a **cloud user**, not much will change for you. You're already using the new dashboard for pipelines, models and artifacts. Your experience won’t change and for the moment you’ll continue using the old dashboard for certain components (notably for stacks and components).

If you're an **open-source user**, the new dashboard is now available to you as part of our latest release (0.57.0). You'll notice a completely refreshed design and a new DAG visualizer.

<div align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="docs/book/.gitbook/assets/new_dashboard_rn_4.png" alt="Dashboard 4"/>
</div>

Unfortunately, some dashboard features are not yet ready so you'll see instructions on how to access them via the CLI. We hope to have these features returned into the product soon. (If you have a strong opinion as to which you'd like to see first, please let us know!) Specifically, secrets, stacks, and service connectors are not yet implemented in the new dashboard.

### How to use the legacy dashboard

The old dashboard is still available to you. To run with the legacy dashboard pass the `--legacy` flag when spinning it up:

```bash
zenml up --legacy
```

Note that you can’t use both the new and old dashboard at the same time.

If you’re self-hosting ZenML instead of using ZenML Pro, you can specify which dashboard you want to use by setting the `ZENML_SERVER_USE_LEGACY_DASHBOARD` environment variable pre-deployment. Specifying a boolean value for this variable will determine which dashboard gets served for your deployment. (There’s no dynamic switching between dashboards allowed, so if you wish to change which dashboard is used for a deployed server, you’ll need to redeploy the server after updating the environment variable.)

If you’re using [SaaS ZenML Pro](https://cloud.zenml.io/), your experience won’t change with this release and your use of the dashboard remains the same.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.56.2...0.56.3

# 0.56.2

This release replaces 0.56.0 and 0.56.1, and fixes the major migration bugs that were in
that yanked release. Please upgrade directly to 0.56.2 and avoid upgrading to  
0.56.0 to avoid unexpected migration issues.

Note that 0.56.0 and 0.56.1 were removed from PyPI due to an issue with the
alembic versions + migration which could affect the database state. This release
fixes that issue.
This release introduces a wide array of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, with a strong emphasis on elevating the user experience and streamlining machine
learning workflows. Most notably, you can now deploy models using Hugging Face inference endpoints thanks for an open-source community contribution of this model deployer stack component!

This release also comes with a breaking change to the services
architecture.

## Breaking Change

A significant change in this release is the migration of the `Service` (ZenML's technical term for deployment)
registration and deployment from local or remote environments to the ZenML server.
This change will be reflected in an upcoming tab in the dashboard which will
allow users to explore and see the deployed models in the dashboard with their live
status and metadata. This architectural shift also simplifies the model deployer
abstraction and streamlines the model deployment process for users by moving from
limited built-in steps to a more documented and flexible approach.

Important note: If you have models that you previously deployed with ZenML, you might
want to redeploy them to have them stored in the ZenML server and tracked by ZenML,
ensuring they appear in the dashboard.

Additionally, the `find_model_server` method now retrieves models (services) from the
ZenML server instead of local or remote deployment environments. As a result, any
usage of `find_model_server` will only return newly deployed models stored in the server.

It is also no longer recommended to call service functions like `service.start()`.
Instead, use `model_deployer.start_model_server(service_id)`, which will allow ZenML
to update the changed status of the service in the server.

### Starting a service
**Old syntax:**
```python
from zenml import pipeline, 
from zenml.integrations.bentoml.services.bentoml_deployment import BentoMLDeploymentService

@step
def predictor(
    service: BentoMLDeploymentService,
) -> None:
    # starting the service
    service.start(timeout=10)
```

**New syntax:**
```python
from zenml import pipeline
from zenml.integrations.bentoml.model_deployers import BentoMLModelDeployer
from zenml.integrations.bentoml.services.bentoml_deployment import BentoMLDeploymentService

@step
def predictor(
    service: BentoMLDeploymentService,
) -> None:
    # starting the service
    model_deployer = BentoMLModelDeployer.get_active_model_deployer()
    model_deployer.start_model_server(service_id=service.service_id, timeout=10)
```

### Enabling continuous deployment

Instead of replacing the parameter that was used in the `deploy_model` method to replace the
existing service (if it matches the exact same pipeline name and step name without
taking into accounts other parameters or configurations), we now have a new parameter,
`continuous_deployment_mode`, that allows you to enable continuous deployment for
the service. This will ensure that the service is updated with the latest version
if it's on the same pipeline and step and the service is not already running. Otherwise,
any new deployment with different configurations will create a new service.

```python
from zenml import pipeline, step, get_step_context
from zenml.client import Client

@step
def deploy_model() -> Optional[MLFlowDeploymentService]:
    # Deploy a model using the MLflow Model Deployer
    zenml_client = Client()
    model_deployer = zenml_client.active_stack.model_deployer
    mlflow_deployment_config = MLFlowDeploymentConfig(
        name: str = "mlflow-model-deployment-example",
        description: str = "An example of deploying a model using the MLflow Model Deployer",
        pipeline_name: str = get_step_context().pipeline_name,
        pipeline_step_name: str = get_step_context().step_name,
        model_uri: str = "runs:/<run_id>/model" or "models:/<model_name>/<model_version>",
        model_name: str = "model",
        workers: int = 1
        mlserver: bool = False
        timeout: int = DEFAULT_SERVICE_START_STOP_TIMEOUT
    )
    service = model_deployer.deploy_model(mlflow_deployment_config, continuous_deployment_mode=True)
    logger.info(f"The deployed service info: {model_deployer.get_model_server_info(service)}")
    return service
```


## Major Features and Enhancements:

* A new `Huggingface Model Deployer` has been introduced, allowing you to seamlessly
deploy your Huggingface models using ZenML. (Thank you so much @dudeperf3ct for the contribution!)
* Faster Integration and Dependency Management ZenML now leverages the `uv` library,
significantly improving the speed of integration installations and dependency management,
resulting in a more streamlined and efficient workflow.
* Enhanced Logging and Status Tracking Logging have been improved, providing better
visibility into the state of your ZenML services.
* Improved Artifact Store Isolation: ZenML now prevents unsafe operations that access
data outside the scope of the artifact store, ensuring better isolation and security.
* Adding admin user notion for the user accounts and added protection to certain operations
performed via the REST interface to ADMIN-allowed only.
* Rate limiting for login API to prevent abuse and protect the server from potential
security threats.
* The LLM template is now supported in ZenML, allowing you to use the LLM template
for your pipelines.


## 🥳 Community Contributions 🥳

We'd like to give a special thanks to @dudeperf3ct he contributed to this release
by introducing the Huggingface Model Deployer. We'd also like to thank @moesio-f

# 0.55.5

This patch contains a number of bug fixes and security improvements.

We improved the isolation of artifact stores so that various artifacts 
cannot be stored or accessed outside of the configured artifact store scope.
Such unsafe operations are no longer allowed. This may have an
impact on existing codebases if you have used unsafe file operations in the past.
To illustrate such a side effect, let's consider a remote S3 
artifact store is configured for the path `s3://some_bucket/some_sub_folder`. 
and in the code you use 
`artifact_store.open("s3://some_bucket/some_other_folder/dummy.txt","w")` 
-> this operation is considered unsafe as it accesses the data outside the scope 
of the artifact store. If you really need this to achieve your goals, 
consider switching to `s3fs` or similar libraries for such cases.

Also with this release, the server global configuration is no longer stored on the 
server file system to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

User entities are now uniquely constrained to prevent the creation of duplicate 
users under certain race conditions.

This patch comes with a variety of bug fixes and documentation updates.

With this release you can now download files directly from artifact versions
that you get back from the client without the need to materialize them. If you
would like to bypass materialization entirely and just download the data or
files associated with a particular artifact version, you can use the
`download_files` method:

```python
from zenml.client import Client

client = Client()
artifact = client.get_artifact_version(name_id_or_prefix="iris_dataset")
artifact.download_files("path/to/save.zip")
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.55.1...0.55.2

# 0.55.1

**If you are actively using the Model Control Plane features, we suggest that you directly upgrade to 0.55.1, bypassing 0.55.0.**

This is a patch release bringing backwards compatibility for breaking changes introduced in **0.55.0**, so that appropriate migration actions can be performed at desired pace. Please refer to [the 0.55.0 release notes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/tag/0.55.0) for specific information on breaking changes and how to update your code to align with the new way of doing things. We also have updated our documentation to serve you better and introduced `PipelineNamespace` models in our API.

Also this release is packed with Database recovery in case upgrade failed to migrate Database to a newer version of ZenML.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.55.0...0.55.1

# 0.55.0

This release comes with a range of new features, bug fixes and documentation updates. The most notable changes are the ability to do lazy loading of Artifacts and their Metadata and Model and its Metadata inside the pipeline code using pipeline context object, and the ability to link Artifacts to Model Versions implicitly via the `save_artifact` function.

Additionally, we've updated the documentation to include a new starter guide on how to manage artifacts, and a new production guide that walks you through how to configure your pipelines to run in production.

## Breaking Change
The `ModelVersion` concept was renamed to `Model` going forward, which affects code bases using the Model Control Plane feature. **This change is not backward compatible with 0.55.0, but is backward compatible again in 0.55.1**.

### Pipeline decorator
`@pipeline(model_version=ModelVersion(...))` -> `@pipeline(model=Model(...))`

**Old syntax:**
```python
from zenml import pipeline, ModelVersion

@pipeline(model_version=ModelVersion(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def p():
  ...
```

**New syntax:**
```python
from zenml import pipeline, Model

@pipeline(model=Model(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def p():
  ...
```
### Step decorator
`@step(model_version=ModelVersion(...))` -> `@step(model=Model(...))`

**Old syntax:**
```python
from zenml import step, ModelVersion

@step(model_version=ModelVersion(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def s():
  ...
```

**New syntax:**
```python
from zenml import step, Model

@step(model=Model(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def s():
  ...
```

### Acquiring model configuration from pipeline/step context

**Old syntax:**
```python
from zenml import pipeline, step, ModelVersion, get_step_context, get_pipeline_context

@pipeline(model_version=ModelVersion(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def p():
  model_version = get_pipeline_context().model_version
  ...

@step(model_version=ModelVersion(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def s():
  model_version = get_step_context().model_version
  ...
```

**New syntax:**
```python
from zenml import pipeline, step, Model, get_step_context, get_pipeline_context

@pipeline(model=Model(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def p():
  model = get_pipeline_context().model
  ...

@step(model=Model(name="model_name",version="v42"))
def s():
  model = get_step_context().model
  ...
```

### Usage of model configuration inside pipeline YAML config file

**Old syntax:**
```yaml
model_version:
  name: model_name
  version: v42
  ...
```

**New syntax:**
```yaml
model:
  name: model_name
  version: v42
  ...
```

### `ModelVersion.metadata` -> `Model.run_metadata`

**Old syntax:**
```python
from zenml import ModelVersion

def s():
  model_version = ModelVersion(name="model_name",version="production")
  some_metadata = model_version.metadata["some_metadata"].value
  ... 
```

**New syntax:**
```python
from zenml import Model

def s():
  model = Model(name="model_name",version="production")
  some_metadata = model.run_metadata["some_metadata"].value
  ... 
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.54.0...0.54.1


# 0.54.0

This release brings a range of new features, bug fixes and documentation
updates. The Model Control Plane has received a number of small bugfixes and
improvements, notably the ability to change model and model version names.

We've also added a whole new starter guide that walks you through
how to get started with ZenML, from creating your first pipeline to fetching
objects once your pipelines have run and much more. Be sure to [check it out](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) if
you're new to ZenML!

Speaking of documentation improvements, the Model Control Plane now has [its own
dedicated documentation section](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/data-management/model-management) introducing the concepts and features of the
Model Control Plane.

As always, this release comes with number of bug fixes, docs additions and
smaller improvements to our internal processes.

## Breaking Change

This PR introduces breaking changes in the areas of the REST API concerning secrets and tags. As a consequence, the ZenML Client running the previous ZenML version is no longer compatible with a ZenML Server running the new version and vice-versa. To address this, simply ensure that all your ZenML clients use the same version as the server(s) they connect to.

## 🥳 Community Contributions 🥳

We'd like to give a special thanks to @christianversloot for two PRs he
contributed to this release. One of them [fixes a bug](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2195) that prevented ZenML from
running on Windows and the other one [adds a new materializer for the Polars library](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2229).

Also many thanks to @sean-hickey-wf for his contribution of [an improvement to
the Slack Alerter stack component](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2153)
which allows you to define custom blocks for the Slack message.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.53.1...0.54.0

# 0.53.1

This minor release contains a hot fix for a bug that was introduced in 0.53.0
where the secrets manager flavors were not removed from the database
properly. This release fixes that issue.

## What's Changed
* Remove secrets manager flavors from DB by @stefannica in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2182

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.53.0...0.53.1

# 0.53.0

This release is packed with a deeply reworked quickstart example and starter template, the removal of secret manager stack component, improved experience with Cloud Secret Stores, support for tags and metadata directly in Model Versions, some breaking changes for Model Control Plane and a few bugfixes.

## Breaking changes

### Secret Manager stack components sunset

Upon upgrading, all Secrets Manager stack components will be removed from the Stacks that still contain them and from the database. This also implies that access to any remaining secrets managed through Secrets Manager stack components will be lost. If you still have secrets configured and managed through Secrets Manager stack components, please consider migrating all your existing secrets to the centralized secrets store *before upgrading* by means of the `zenml secrets-manager secret migrate` CLI command. Also see the `zenml secret --help` command for more information.

### Renaming "endpoints" to "deployments" in Model Control Plane

This is just a renaming to provide better alignment with industry standards. Though, it will affect:
- `ArtifactConfig(..., is_endpoint_artifact=True)` now is `ArtifactConfig(..., is_deployment_artifact=True)`
- CLI command `zenml model endpoint_artifacts ...` now is `zenml model deployment_artifacts ...`
- `Client().list_model_version_artifact_links(..., only_endpoint_artifacts=True)` now is `Client().list_model_version_artifact_links(..., only_deployment_artifacts=True)`
- `ModelVersion(...).get_endpoint_artifact(...)` now is `ModelVersion(...).get_deployment_artifact(...)`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.52.0...0.53.0

# 0.52.0

This adds the ability to pass in pipeline parameters as YAML configuration and fixes a couple of minor issues affecting the W&B integration and the way expiring credentials are refreshed when service connectors are used.

## Breaking Change

The current pipeline YAML configurations are now being validated to ensure that configured parameters match what is available in the code. This means that if you have a pipeline that is configured with a parameter that has a different value that what is provided through code, the pipeline will fail to run. This is a breaking change, but it is a good thing as it will help you catch errors early on.

This is an example of a pipeline configuration that will fail to run:

```yaml
parameters:
    some_param: 24

steps:
  my_step:
    parameters:
      input_2: 42
```

```python
# run.py
@step
def my_step(input_1: int, input_2: int) -> None:
    pass

@pipeline
def my_pipeline(some_param: int):
    # here an error will be raised since `input_2` is
    # `42` in config, but `43` was provided in the code
    my_step(input_1=42, input_2=43)

if __name__=="__main__":
    # here an error will be raised since `some_param` is
    # `24` in config, but `23` was provided in the code
    my_pipeline(23)
```

## What's Changed

* Side-effect free tests by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2065
* Fix various bugs by @stefannica in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2124

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.50.0...0.51.0


# 0.50.0

In this release, we introduce key updates aimed at improving user experience and security.
The `ModelConfig` object has been renamed to `ModelVersion` for a more intuitive interface.
Additionally, the release features enhancements such as optimized model hydration for better performance,
alongside a range of bug fixes and contributions from both new and returning community members.

## Breaking Change
- We have renamed the `ModelConfig` object to `ModelVersion` with other related changes to the model control plane,
  the goal of this is to bring a simplified user-interface experience, so once ModelVersion is configured in
  @pipeline or @step it will travel into all other user-facing places: step context, client, etc. by @avishniakov in [#2044](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2044)
- introducing RBAC for server endpoints, ensuring users have appropriate permissions for actions on resources.
  Additionally, it improves data handling by dehydrating response models to redact inaccessible information, while
  service accounts retain full permissions due to current database constraints. by @schustmi in [#1999](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1999)

## Enhancements
- Optimizing model hydration by @bcdurak in [#1971](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1971)

- Model version endpoint fixes by @schustmi in [#2060](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2060)

## ZenML Helm Chart Changes
- Make helm chart more robust to accidental secret deletions by @stefannica in [#2053](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2053)
- Separate helm hook resources from regular resources by @stefannica in [#2055](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2055)

# 0.47.0
This release fixes a bug that was introduced in 0.46.1 where the default user 
was made inaccessible and was inadvertently duplicated. This release rescues 
the original user and renames the duplicate.

## What's Changed
* Create tags table by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2036
* Bring dashboard back to the release by @avishniakov in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/2046

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.46.1...tmp

# 0.46.1

The 0.46.1 release introduces support for Service Accounts and API Keys that
can be used to authenticate with the ZenML server from environments that do not
support the web login flow, such as CI/CD environments, for example.

Also included in this release are some documentation updates and bug fixes,
notably moving the database migration logic deployed with the Helm chart out of
the init containers and into a Kubernetes Job, which makes it possible to scale
out the ZenML server deployments without the risk of running into database
migration conflicts.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.46.0..0.46.1


# 0.46.0

This release brings some upgrades, documentation updates and bug fixes. Notably,
our `langchain` integration now supports more modern versions and has been
upgraded to a new version at the lower edge of supported packages on account of
a security vulnerability.

Other fixes related to the Model Control Plane which was updated to support the
deletion of model versions via the CLI, for example.

## Breaking Change

We removed the `llama_index` integration in this release. This related to
unsolvable dependency clashes that relate to `sqlmodel` and our database. We
expect these clashes to be resolved in the future and then we will add our
integration back in. If you were using the `llama_index` materializer that was
part of the integration, you will have to use a custom materializer in the
meanwhile. We apologize for the inconvenience.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.45.2...0.45.3

# 0.45.2

This release replaces 0.45.0 and 0.45.1, and fixes the major migration bugs that were in
that yanked release. Please upgrade directly to 0.45.2 and avoid upgrading to
0.45.0 to avoid unexpected migration issues.

Note that 0.45.0 and 0.45.1 were removed from PyPI due to an issue with the
alembic versions + migration which could affect the database state. This release
fixes that issue.

If you have already upgraded to 0.45.0 please [let us know in Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/) and we'll happy to assist in rollback and recovery.

This release introduces a major upgrade to ZenML, featuring a new authentication mechanism, performance improvements, the introduction of the model control plane, and internal enhancements.

## New Authentication Mechanism (#4303)

Our improved authentication mechanism offers a more secure way of connecting to the ZenML server. It initiates a device flow that prompts you to log in via the browser dashboard:

```
zenml connect --url <YOUR_SERVER_URL>
```

This eliminates the need for explicit credential input. The previous method (`zenml connect --url <URL> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>`) remains operational but is less recommended due to security concerns. 

**Critical** This change disrupts existing pipeline schedules. After upgrading, manually cancel and reschedule pipelines using the updated version of ZenML.

For more information, read about the device flow in our [documentation](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/switch-to-production).

## Performance enhancements (#3207)

Internal API adjustments have reduced the footprint of ZenML API objects by up to 35%. This will particularly benefit users with large step and pipeline configurations. Further reductions will be implemented in our next release. 

## Model Control Plane debut (#5648)

ZenML now includes a preliminary version of the model control plane, a feature for registering models and their metadata on a single ZenML dashboard view. Future releases will provide more details. To test this early version, follow this [example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-plugins/tree/main/model_control_plane).

## Breaking Changes

- Environment variables `ZENML_AUTH_TYPE` and `ZENML_JWT_SECRET_KEY` have been renamed to `ZENML_SERVER_AUTH_SCHEME` and `ZENML_SERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY`, respectively.
- All ZenML server-issued JWT tokens now include an issuer and an audience. After the server update, current scheduled pipelines become invalidated. Reset your schedules and reconnect all clients to the server to obtain new tokens.
- `UnmaterializedArtifact` has been relocated to `zenml.artifacts`. Change your import statement from `from zenml.materializers import UnmaterializedArtifact` to `from zenml.artifacts.unmaterialized_artifact import UnmaterializedArtifact`.

## Deprecations

- `zenml.steps.external_artifact.ExternalArtifact` has moved to `zenml.artifacts.external_artifact.ExternalArtifact`.

# 0.44.3

## New Orchestrator: SkyPilot (#1765)

This release introduces a new orchestrator called SkyPilot. SkyPilot is a VM orchestrator
that can be used to run ZenML pipelines on a VM of choice in one of the three supported
cloud providers. It is a great choice for users who want to run ZenML pipelines on a GPU
instance, but don't want to use Kubernetes or serverless orchestrators like SageMaker.

## Fixes and Improvements

This release fixes several bugs and improves the user experience of the CLI and the
documentation. The most notable changes are:
* The new `connect` command that allows connecting all stack components within a stack to a
service connector with a single command.
* Adding an interactive flow to the `zenml stack deploy` command that allows users to
configure their stack in a guided manner.
* Add documentation on how to debug the SageMaker orchestrator, how to get started with
a quick cloud stack on GCP, and documentation on the use of service connectors with
enabled MFA.

# 0.44.2

This release contains updates for some of the most popular integrations, as well as several bug fixes and documentation improvements. 

## Minor Default Behavior Changes
* The default page size for `zenml list` commands was reduced to 20 (from 50) to speed up the runtime of such commands.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.44.1...0.44.2

# 0.44.1

This release brings various improvements over the previous version, mainly 
focusing on the usage of newly refactored `mlstacks` package, ZenML's `logging` 
module and the changes in our analytics.

**Note:** *0.44.0 was removed from pypi due to an issue with the alembic versions which could affect the database state. A branch occurred in the versions: 0.42.1 -> [0.43.0, e1d66d91a099] -> 0.44.0. This release fixes the issue.<br>
The primary issue arises when deploying version 0.44.0 using a MySQL backend. Although the alembic migration executes all tasks up to 0.44.0, the alembic version represented in the database remains at 0.43.0. This issue persists irrespective of the measures taken, including trying various versions after 0.43.0.<br>
This imbalance leads to failure when running a second replica migration because the database's state is at 0.44.0 while the alembic version remains at 0.43.0. Similarly, attempts to run a second replica or restart the pod fail as the alembic tries to migrate from 0.43.0 to 0.44.0, which is not possible because these changes already exist in the database.<br>
Please note: If you encounter this problem, we recommend that you rollback to previous versions and then upgrade to 0.43.0. If you still experience difficulties, please join our Slack community at https://zenml.io/slack. We're ready to help you work through this issue.*

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.43.0...0.44.0

# 0.43.0

This release brings limited support for Python 3.11, 
improves quickstart experience with the fully reworked flow, 
enhances the user experience while dealing with ZenML docs, 
offers new extended templates for projects, 
and fixes GCP connector creation issue.

## Limited support for Python 3.11
This release adds limited support for Python 3.11.
The following integrations are currently not supported with Python 3.11:
- gcp
- kubeflow
- tekton

This is because:
- GCP packages that support Python 3.11 are not compatible with KFP 1
- Upgrade to KFP 2 is blocked by the fact that Tekton doesn't have any release compatible with KFP 2 yet (https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1697) 

## Breaking Changes

A minor breaking change in CLI for `zenml init`:
- previously supported flag `--starter`
- new flag `--template-with-defaults`
- behavior remains the same - flag is responsible for usage of default settings in the template

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.42.0...0.43.0

# 0.42.1

This is a minor release that fixes a couple of minor issues and improves the
quickstart example.

## Breaking Changes

### Disable Implicit Auth Methods for Service Connectors by Default

The implicit authentication methods supported by cloud Service Connectors method
may constitute a security risk, because they can give users access to the same
cloud resources and services that the ZenML Server itself is allowed to access.

For this reason, the default behavior of ZenML Service Connectors has been
changed to disable implicit authentication methods by default. If you try to
configure any of the AWS, GCP or Azure Service Connectors using the implicit
authentication method, you will now receive an error message.

To enable implicit authentication methods, you have to set the
`ZENML_ENABLE_IMPLICIT_AUTH_METHODS` environment variable or the ZenML helm
chart `enableImplicitAuthMethods` configuration option to `true`.

## What's Changed
* Disable implicit auth methods for service connectors by default by @stefannica in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1704
* New quickstart by @strickvl in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1692
* Set `MLflow` configuration as environment variables before deployment subprocess by @safoinme in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1705
* Fix Migration Guide Links by @fa9r in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1706


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.42.0...0.42.1

# 0.42.0

This release brings major user experience improvements to how ZenML logs are
managed and displayed, removes Python 3.7 support, and fixes the Python 3.10 
PyYAML issues caused by the Cython 3.0 release.

## Improved Logging UX

The log messages written by ZenML when running pipelines or executing ZenML CLI
commands are now more concise and easier to digest and the log message colors
were adjusted to be more intuitive. Additionally, all log messages, including 
custom prints to stdout, now show up as step logs in the dashboard.

## Breaking Changes

### Python 3.7 Support Dropped
Python 3.7 reached its end of life on on June 27th, 2023. Since then, several 
MLOps tools have stopped supporting Python 3.7. To prevent dependency issues 
with our integrations and other open-source packages, ZenML will also no longer
support Python 3.7 starting from this release.

### Dependency and Integration Version Updates
ZenML now requires PyYAML 6 since older versions are broken under Python 3.10. 
Subsequently, the following integrations now require a higher package version:
- Kubeflow now requires `kfp==1.8.22`
- Tekton now requires `kfk-tekton==1.7.1`
- Evidently now requires `evidently==0.2.7` or `evidently==0.2.8`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.41.0...0.42.0


# 0.41.0

ZenML release 0.41.0 comes with a second round of updates to the pipeline and
step interface with major changes in how step outputs are defined, how 
information about previous runs can be fetched programmatically, and how
information about the current run can be obtained.

See [this docs page](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/migration-guide/migration-zero-forty)
for an overview of all pipeline interface changes introduced since release
0.40.0 and for more information on how to migrate your existing ZenML pipelines 
to the latest syntax.

## Fetching Runs Programmatically (#1635)
The entire syntax of fetching previous runs programmatically was majorly
redesigned. While the overall user flow is still almost identical, the new 
approach does not contain pipeline-versioning-related inconsistencies, has a 
more intuitive syntax, and is also easier for users to learn since the new 
syntax uses the ZenML Client and response models natively instead of requiring 
the `zenml.post_execution` util functions and corresponding `...View` wrapper 
classes.

## Accessing Current Run Information (#1648)
How to fetch information about the current pipeline run from within the run has
been majorly redesigned:
- Instead of being an argument of the step function, the `StepContext` is now a 
singleton that can be accessed via the new `zenml.get_step_context()` function.
- The `StepContext` is now decoupled from the `StepEnvironment` and the 
`StepEnvironment` is deprecated.
- The `StepContext` now contains the full `PipelineRunResponseModel` and 
`StepRunResponseModel` so all information about the run is accessible, not 
just the name / id / params.

## Defining Step Outputs (#1653)
Instead of using the `zenml.steps.Output` class to annotate steps with multiple
outputs, ZenML can now handle `Tuple` annotations natively and output names can
now be assigned to any step output using `typing_extensions.Annotated`.

# 0.40.3

This is a minor ZenML release that introduces a couple of new features:

* the [Azure Service Connector](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/auth-management/azure-service-connector) is now available in addition to the AWS and GCP ones. It can be used to connect ZenML and Stack Components to Azure cloud infrastructure resources like Azure Blob Storage, Azure Container Registry and Azure Kubernetes Service.
* Service Connectors can now also be managed through the ZenML Dashboard
* adds `zenml secret export` CLI command to export secrets from the ZenML Secret Store to a local file
* adds the ability to create/update ZenML secrets from JSON/YAML files or command line arguments (courtesy of @bhatt-priyadutt)

In addition to that, this release also contains a couple of bug fixes and improvements, including:

* better documentation and fixes for the ZenML [Vertex AI Orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/vertex) and [Vertex AI Step Operator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/step-operators/vertex)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.40.0...0.40.1

# 0.40.0

ZenML release 0.40.0 introduces two big updates: a fresh and more flexible pipeline interface and a new way to connect and authenticate with external services in ZenML Connectors. See below for full details on these two major new sets of functionality.

The release also contains many bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. Specifically, we reworked our documentation from the ground up with particular attention to the structure to help you find what you need. Our [Label Studio integration example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/label_studio_annotation) is now working again and allows you to use more recent versions of the `label-studio` package that backs it.

## A Fresh Pipeline Interface

This release introduces a completely reworked interface for developing your ZenML steps and pipelines:

* Increased flexibility when defining steps: Steps can now have `Optional`, `Union`, and `Any` type annotations for their inputs and outputs. Additionally, default values are allowed for step inputs.

```python
@step
def trainer(data: pd.Dataframe, start_model: Union[svm.SVC, svm.SVR], coef0: Optional[int] = None) -> Any:
    pass
```

* You can now easily run a step outside of a pipeline, making it easier to test and debug your code:

```python
trainer(data=pd.Dataframe(...), start_model=svc.SVC(...))
```

* External artifacts can be used to pass values to steps that are not produced by an upstream step. This provides more flexibility when working with external data or models:

```python
from zenml.steps.external_artifact import ExternalArtifact

@pipeline
def my_pipeline(lr: float):
    data = process_data()
    trainer(data=data, start_model=ExternalArtifact(svc.SVC(...)))
```

* You can now call steps multiple times inside a pipeline, allowing you to create more complex workflows and reuse steps with different parameters:

```python
@pipeline
def my_pipeline(step_count: int) -> None:
    data = load_data_step()
    after = []
    for i in range(step_count):
        train_step(data, learning_rate=i * 0.0001, id=f"train_step_{i}")
        after.append(f"train_step_{i}")
    model = select_model_step(..., after=after)
```

* Pipelines can now define inputs and outputs, providing a clearer interface for working with data and dependencies between pipelines:

```python
@pipeline(enable_cache=False)
def subpipeline(pipeline_param: int):
    out = step_1(k=None)
    step_2(a=3, b=pipeline_param)
    return 17
```

* You can now call pipelines within other pipelines. This currently does not execute the inner pipeline but instead adds its steps to the parent pipeline, allowing you to create modular and reusable workflows:

```python
@pipeline(enable_cache=False)
def my_pipeline(a: int = 1):
    p1_output = subpipeline(pipeline_param=22)
    step_2(a=a, b=p1_output)
```

To get started, simply import the new `@step` and `@pipeline` decorator and check out our new [starter guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) for more information.

```python
from zenml import step, pipeline

@step
def my_step(...):
    ...

@pipeline
def my_pipeline(...):
    ...
```

The old pipeline and step interface is still working using the imports from previous ZenML releases but is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

## 'Connectors' for authentication

In this update, we're pleased to present a new feature to ZenML: Service Connectors. The intention behind these connectors is to offer a reliable and more user-friendly method for integrating ZenML with external resources and services. We aim to simplify processes such as validating, storing, and generating security-sensitive data, along with the authentication and authorization of access to external services. We believe ZenML Service Connectors will be a useful tool to alleviate some of the common challenges in managing pipeline across various Stack Components.

Regardless of your background in infrastructure management - whether you're a beginner looking for quick cloud stack integration, or an experienced engineer focused on maintaining robust infrastructure security practices - our Service Connectors are designed to assist your work while maintaining high security standards.

Here are just a few ways you could use ZenML Service Connectors:

- Easy utilization of cloud resources: With ZenML's Service Connectors, you can use resources from AWS, GCP, and Azure without the need for extensive knowledge of cloud infrastructure or environment configuration. All you'll need is a ZenML Service Connector and a few Python libraries.
- Assisted setup with security in mind: Our Service Connectors come with features for configuration validation and verification, the generation of temporary, low-privilege credentials, and pre-authenticated and pre-configured clients for Python libraries.
- Easy local configuration transfer: ZenML's Service Connectors aim to resolve the reproducibility issue in ML pipelines. They do this by automatically transferring authentication configurations and credentials from your local machine, storing them securely, and allowing for effortless sharing across different environments.

[Visit our documentation pages](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/auth-management) to learn more about ZenML Connectors and how you can use them in a way that supports your ML workflows.

## What's Changed
* Fix Source Resolving in Colab by @fa9r in https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/1530

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.39.0...0.39.1

# 0.39.0

ZenML release 0.39.0 introduces several big new features:
- The `zenml stack recipe` CLI commands now support fine-grained handling of
individual stack components.
- Artifacts are now automatically visualized in the dashboard.
- Materializers received an overhaul: a new `cloudpickle` default materializer
was added that works for arbitrary objects, and a `pycaret` materializer
that can handle various modeling frameworks in a unified format.

The release also contains many bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements, such 
as new settings options for the SageMaker and Kubernetes orchestrators.

## Individual Stack Component Deployment

In this release, we've enhanced the ZenML stack recipe CLI to support 
conditional deployment, destruction, and configuration of individual stack 
components. Users can now quickly deploy and destroy components with options for 
each flavor, and pass a config file for custom variables. The new `output` CLI 
command allows users to retrieve outputs from their recipes. Overall, this 
update streamlines deploying and managing stack components by providing a more 
efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Artifact Visualization

Artifact visualizations are now automatically extracted by ZenML and embedded in
the ZenML dashboard. Visualizations can now be defined by overriding the 
`save_visualizations` method of the materializer that handles an artifact. 
These visualizations are then automatically shown in the dashboard and can also 
be displayed in Jupyter notebooks using the new `visualize` post-execution 
method.

## Default Cloudpickle Materializer

ZenML now uses `cloudpickle` under the hood to save/load artifacts that other 
materializers cannot handle. This makes it even easier to get started with 
ZenML since you no longer need to define custom materializers if you just
want to experiment with some new data types.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.38.0...0.39.0

# 0.38.0

The 0.38.0 ZenML release is a major milestone for the ZenML project. It marks
the introduction of the ZenML Hub, a central platform that enables our users to
search, share and discover community-contributed code, such as stack component
flavors, materializers, and pipeline steps. The ZenML Hub allows our users to
extend their ZenML experience by leveraging the community's diverse range of
implementations and MLOps best practices.

If you're interested in learning more about our motivation for implementing the 
ZenML Hub and our plans for its future, we invite you to read 
[our new blog post](https://blog.zenml.io/zenml-hub-launch). In addition to 
this technical documentation, the blog post provides a comprehensive overview 
of the ZenML Hub's goals and objectives, as well as the features that 
we plan to introduce in the future.

Aside from this major new feature, the release also includes a number of small
improvements and bug fixes.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.37.0...0.38.0

# 0.37.0

In this ZenML release, we are pleased to introduce a compelling new feature:
[ZenML Code Repositories](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/production-fundamentals/code-repositories).
This innovative addition formalizes the principles of code versioning and
tracking while consolidating their pivotal role in executing pipelines and
caching pipeline steps. With Code Repositories, ZenML is equipped to maintain an
accurate record of the code version employed in your pipeline runs. Furthermore,
executing a pipeline that is monitored by a registered code repository can
significantly accelerate the Docker image building process for containerized
stack components.

As is the case with everything ZenML, we designed the ZenML Code Repository
concept as a highly extensible abstraction. The update defines the basic Code
Repository interface an includes two implementations integrating ZenML with
two popular code repository flavors: GitHub and GitLab.

## Other Enhancements

We've updated the `pytorch-lightning` integration to support the `2.0` version.
We also updated the `mlflow` integration to support the `2.2.2` version.

**IMPORTANT**: it is not recommended to continue using MLflow older than `2.2.1`
as a model registry with ZenML, as [it is vulnerable to a security issue](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg73-94fp-g449). 

Last but not least, two stellar additions from our community members:

* `zenml stack delete` now supports a `--recursive` flag to delete all
  components in a stack. Many thanks to @KenmogneThimotee for the contribution!
* the ZenML Sagemaker step operator has been expanded to support S3 input data
  and additional input arguments. Many thanks to @christianversloot for the
  contribution!

## Breaking Changes

The ZenML GitHub Orchestrator and GitHub Secrets Manager have been removed in
this release. Given that their concerns overlapped with the new ZenML GitHub
Code Repository and they didn't provide sufficient value on their own, we
decided to discontinue them. If you were using these components, you can
continue to use GitHub Actions to run your pipelines, in combination with the
ZenML GitHub Code Repository.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.36.1...0.37.0

# 0.36.1

This minor release contains some small fixes and improvements.

- We fixed a bug with the way hooks were being parsed, which was causing
  pipelines to fail.
- We brought various parts of the documentation up to date with features that
  had previously been added, notably the new image building functionality.
- We added a failure hook that connects to OpenAI's ChatGPT API to allow you to
  receive a message when a pipeline fails that includes suggestions on how to
  fix the failing step.
- We added a new integration with `langchain` and `llama_hub` to allow you to
  build on top of those libraries as part of a more robust MLOps workflow.
- We made the first some bigger changes to our analytics system to make it more
  robust and secure. This release begins that migration. Users should expect no
  changes in behavior and all telemetry-related preferences will be preserved.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.36.0...0.36.1

# 0.36.0

Our latest release adds hooks to ZenML pipelines to handle custom logic that
occurs on pipeline failure or success. This is a powerful feature that allows
you to easily receive custom alerts, for example, when a pipeline fails or
succeeds. (Check out our video showcasing the feature
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUW2G3EsqF8).)

The release is also packed with bug fixes and documentation updates. Some
smaller improvements include an increase of the `step_configurations` column
size in the database to accommodate really large configurations and the ability
to click through to orchestrator logs for the Sagemaker orchestrator directly
from the ZenML dashboard.

## Breaking Changes

Secrets are now handled internally by ZenML. This changes some behaviors that
you may have become used to with the (now-deprecated) Secrets Manager stack
component. The default behavior for the KServe and Seldon Core Model Deployer if
explicit credentials are not configured through the secret stack component
attribute has changed. Now, the model deployer will attempt to reuse credentials
configured for the Artifact Store in the same stack and may, in some cases, fail
if it cannot use them. In most cases, if credentials are not configured for the
active Artifact Store, the model deployer will assume some form of implicit
in-cloud authentication is configured for the Kubernetes cluster where KServe /
Seldon Core is installed and default to using that.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.35.1...test

# 0.35.1

**Note:** *This release replaces the previous 0.35.0 release that was yanked from
PyPI due to a bug. If you already installed 0.35.0 and are experiencing issues,
we recommend you downgrade to 0.34.0 before installing and upgrading to 0.35.1.*

This release is packed with big features as well as documentation updates and
some bug fixes.

The 0.35.1 release puts models front and center in ZenML with the addition of
the **Model Registry** abstraction and Stack Component. You can now register,
version and manage models as first class citizens in ZenML. This is a major
milestone for ZenML and we are excited to see what you build with it!
The introduction of Model Registries greatly simplifies the journey that the
model takes from training to deployment and extends the ZenML ecosystem to
include model registry tools and libraries. The first Model Registry integration
included in this release is MLFlow, with many more to come in the future.

This release also continues the deprecation of Secrets Managers and the
introduction of Secret Stores. You now have the option of configuring the ZenML
server to use AWS, GCP, Azure or Hashicorp Vault directly as a centralized
secrets store back-end. This is meant to replace all Secrets Manager flavors
which were previously used to store secrets using the same cloud services.

Please be reminded that all Secrets Managers are now deprecated and will be
removed in the near future. We recommend that you migrate all your secrets from
the Secrets Manager stack components to the centralized secrets store by means
of the included `zenml secrets-manager secret migrate` CLI command.

Last but not least, this release includes an updated Evidently integration that
is compatible with the latest and greatest features from Evidently: reports and
test suites. Check out the updated example to get a feel for the new features.

## Breaking Changes

This release introduces a few breaking changes. Please update your code to
reflect the changes below:

* the order of pipelines and runs in the post-execution results has been
reversed. This means that the most recent pipeline and pipeline run can be
accessed using the first index of the respective lists instead of the last
index. This change was made to make the post-execution results more intuitive
and to allow returning multi-page results in the future. This is a code snippet
outlining the changes that you need to make in your post-execution code:

    ```python
    from zenml.post_execution import get_pipelines, get_unlisted_runs

    pipelines = get_pipelines()

    # instead of calling this to get the pipeline last created
    latest_pipeline = pipelines[-1]

    # you now have to call this
    latest_pipeline = pipelines[0]

    # and instead of calling this to get the latest run of a pipeline
    latest_pipeline_run = latest_pipeline.get_runs()[-1]
    # or
    latest_pipeline_run = latest_pipeline.runs[-1]
    
    # you now have to call this
    latest_pipeline_run = latest_pipeline.get_runs()[0]
    # or
    latest_pipeline_run = latest_pipeline.runs[0]

    # the same applies to the unlisted runs; instead of
    last_unlisted_run = get_unlisted_runs()[-1]

    # you now have to call this
    last_unlisted_run = get_unlisted_runs()[0]
    ```

* if you were using the `StepEnvironment` to fetch the name of the active step
in your step implementation, this name no longer reflects the name of the step
function. Instead, it now reflects the name of the step used in the pipeline
DAG, similar to what you would see in the ZenML dashboard when visualizing the
pipeline. This is also implicitly reflected in the output of `zenml model-deployer model`
CLI commands.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.34.0...0.35.0

# 0.34.0

This release comes with major upgrades to the python library as well as the dashboard:
- You can now store you secrets in a centralized way instead of having them
tied to a secrets manager stack component. The secrets manager component is deprecated but will still
work while we continue migrating all secrets manager flavors to be available as a backend to store centralized
secrets. Check out [the docs](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/production-fundamentals/secrets-management)
for more information.
- Pipelines are now versioned: ZenML detects changes to your steps and structure of your pipelines and
automatically creates new pipeline versions for you.
- You can now build the required Docker images for your pipeline without actually running it with
the `zenml pipeline build` command. This build can later be used to run the pipeline using the
`zenml pipeline run` command or by passing it to `pipeline.run()` in python.
- Metadata for runs and artifacts is now displayed in the dashboard: When viewing a pipeline run in the dashboard,
click on a step or artifact to get useful metadata like the endpoint where your model is deployed or
statistics about your training data.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.33.0...0.34.0

# 0.33.0

This release introduces several big new features:
- Docker images can now be built in GCP using the new 
[Google Cloud Image Builder](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/image-builders/gcloud-build)
integration. Special shoutout to @gabrielmbmb for this amazing contribution!
- Getting started with ZenML has been made even easier. You can now use one of
the new [ZenML Project Templates](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-project-templates)
to initialize your ZenML repository with a basic project structure including a
functional pipeline and basic scaffolding for materializers, parameters, and
other classes you might want to extend.
- Orchestrating runs on local Kubernetes has been made easier: The KubeFlow, 
Kubernetes, and Tekton orchestrators have been redesigned to be compatible with 
the [K3D modular stack recipe](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks/tree/main/k3d-modular)
that lets you spin up a local K3D Kubernetes cluster with a single line of code!
- The MLflow integration has been updated and can now be used with the new 
MLflow 2.x!
- You can now specify parameters and resources for your Seldon model deployers
thanks to @d-lowl!

Furthermore, the internal `project` concept has been renamed to `workspace` to
avoid confusion with the [zenml-projects](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects) 
repository. This should only be relevant to you if you have custom applications
that are interacting with the REST API of the ZenML server directly since all 
models sent from/to the server need to contain a `workspace` instead of a 
`project` now.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.32.0...0.32.1

# 0.32.0

Release 0.32.0 introduces two big new features:
* A new stack component, the "image builder", with a corresponding new Kaniko
integration.
* Logic for filtering and pagination of list requests.

## Image Builder Abstraction and Kaniko Integration
ZenML stacks can now contain an image builder as additional optional stack 
component. The image builder defines how the Docker images are built that are
required by many of the other stack components such as Airflow or Kubeflow.
Previously, all image building was handled implicitly by ZenML using local
Docker, which has now been refactored into the "local" image builder flavor.
As an alternative, you can now install the new "kaniko" integration to build
your images in Kubernetes using Kaniko.

## Filtering and Pagination
All list commands in ZenML are now capable of advanced filtering such as
`zenml stack list --created="gt:22-12-04 17:00:00" --name contains:def`.

Additionally, list commands now return pages of results, which significantly
improves performance for power ZenML users that have already created many runs
or other entities.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.31.1...0.32.0

# 0.31.1

This release includes several bug fixes and new additions under the hood such as 
testing for various internal utility functions. This should help keep ZenML more 
stable over time. Additionally, we added the ability to customize default 
materializers for custom artifact stores, and the ability to track system info 
and the Python version of pipeline runs (both where pipelines are initially 
executed as well as wherever they eventually run). We added better support for 
pipeline scheduling (particularly from within the CLI) and tracking of the 
source code of steps. The release also includes the addition of information 
about whether the pipeline is running on a stack created by the active user, and
the ability to specify Kubernetes container resource requests and limits. 
Finally, we addressed issues with caching such that caching is enabled for steps
that have explicit enable_cache=True specified (even when pipelines have it 
turned off).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.30.0...0.31.0

# 0.30.0

In this release, ZenML finally adds Mac M1 support, Python 3.10 support and much
greater flexibility and configurability under the hood by deprecating some 
large dependencies like `ml-pipelines-sdk`.

## Scheduling

Based on some community feedback around scheduling, this release comes with
improved docs concerning scheduling in general. Additionally, the Vertex AI
orchestrator now also supports scheduling.

## Slimmer Dependencies

By removing dependencies on some of the packages that ZenML was built on, this 
version of ZenML is slimmer, faster and more configurable than ever. This also
finally makes ZenML run natively on Macs with M1 processors without the need for
Rosetta. This also finally enables ZenML to run on Python 3.10.

## Breaking Changes

* The removal of `ml-pipelines-sdk` and `tfx` leads to some larger changes in 
the database that is tracking your pipeline runs and artifacts. **Note**: There
is an automatic migration to upgrade this automatically, However, please note
that downgrading back down to 0.23.0 is not supported.
* The CLI commands to export and import pipeline runs have been deprecated. 
Namely: `zenml pipeline runs export` and `zenml pipeline runs import`
These commands were meant for migrating from `zenml<0.20.0` to 
`0.20.0<=zenml<0.30.0`. 
* The `azure-ml` integration dependency on `azureml-core` has been upgraded 
from `1.42` to `1.48`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.23.0...0.30.0

# 0.23.0

This release comes with a brand-new Neptune integration to track your ML experiments
as well as lots of performance improvements!

## Neptune integration

The new [Neptune integration](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/neptune_tracking)
includes a Neptune experiment tracker component that allows you to track your machine learning experiments
using Neptune.

## Performance Optimization

The 0.20.0 release introduced our new server but brought with it a few performance and scalability issues.
Since then, we've made many improvements to it, and this release is the final and biggest boost in performance. We reduced the amount of server calls needed for almost all CLI commands and greatly improved the speed of the dashboard as well.

## PyArrow dependency removal

We've removed PyArrow as a dependency of the `zenml` python package.
As a consequence of that, our NumPy and Pandas materializer no
longer read and write their artifacts using PyArrow but instead use
native formats instead. If you still want to use PyArrow to serialize
your NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes, you'll need to install it manually
like this: `pip install pyarrow`

In future releases we'll get rid of other unnecessary dependencies to
further slim down the `zenml` package.

## Breaking Changes

The following changes introduces with this release may require some manual
intervention to update your current installations:

- If your code calls some methods of our `Client` class, it might need to be
updated to the new model classes introduced by the performance optimization changes
explained above
- The CLI command to remove an attribute from a stack component now takes no more dashes
in front of the attribute names:
`zenml stack-component remove-attribute <COMPONENT_NAME> <ATTRIBUTE_NAME>`
- If you're using a custom stack component and have overridden the `cleanup_step_run` method,
you'll need to update the method signature to include a `step_failed` parameter.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.22.0...0.23.0

# 0.22.0

The 0.22.0 release comes with a new BentoML integration as well as a reworked
Airflow orchestrator. Additionally, it greatly improves the server performance
as well as other small fixes and updates to our docs!

## BentoML integration

The new [BentoML integration](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/bentoml_deployment)
includes a BentoML model deployer component that allows you to deploy
your models from any of the major machine learning frameworks on your local machine.
## Airflow orchestrator v2

The previous Airflow orchestrator was limited to running locally and had many
additional unpleasant constraints that made it hard to work with. This 
release includes a completely rewritten, new version of the Airflow orchestrator
that now relies on Docker images to run your pipelines and works both locally
and with remote Airflow deployments.

## Notable bugfixes

- Further improvements to the synchronization that transfers pipeline run information from
the MLMD database to the ZenML Server.
- The ZenML Label Studio integration can now be used with non-local (i.e.
deployed) instances. For more information see [the Label Studiodocs](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/annotators/label-studio).
- The Spark example is fixed and now works again end-to-end.

## Breaking Changes

The following changes introduces with this release may require some manual
intervention to update your current installations:

* the Airflow orchestrator now requires a newer version of Airflow
(run `zenml integration install airflow` to upgrade) and Docker installed
to work.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.21.0...0.21.1

# 0.21.0

This release primarily fixes a number of bugs that were introduced as part of
the 0.20.0 ZenServer release. These significantly improve the stability when
using ZenML with the ZenML Server.

Notable fixes include:

- Improved the synchronization that transfers pipeline run information from
the MLMD database to the ZenML Server. This helps fix a number of issues with
missing steps in the post-execution workflow, model deployment steps and other
issues.
- The Label Studio example is fixed and now works again end-to-end.
- The ZenML Label Studio integration can now be used with non-local (i.e.
deployed) instances. For more information see [the Label Studiodocs](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/annotators/label-studio).

New features and other improvements:

- ZenML now uses [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) for
automated database migrations. The migrations happen automatically after every
ZenML update.
- New `zenml pipeline runs export / import / migrate` CLI commands are now
available to export, import and migrate pipeline runs from older, pre-0.20.0
versions of ZenML. The ZenML server now also automatically picks up older
pipeline runs that have been logged in the metadata store by ZenML prior to
0.20.0.
- An MLMD gRPC service can now be deployed with the ZenML Helm chart to act
as a proxy between clients, orchestrators and the MySQL database. This
significantly reduces the time it takes to run pipelines locally.
- You can now specify affinity and tolerations and node selectors to all
Kubernetes based orchestrators with the new Kubernetes Pod settings feature.


## Breaking Changes

The following changes introduces with this release may require some manual
intervention to update your current installations:

* the zenml server helm chart `values.yaml` file has been restructured to make
  it easier to configure and to clearly distinguish between the zenml server
  component and the newly introduced gRPC service component. Please update your
  `values.yaml` copies accordingly.
* the Azure integration dependency versions have been updated. Please run
  `zenml integration install azure` to update your current installation, if
  you're using Azure.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.20.1...0.20.2

# 0.20.0 / 0.20.1

The ZenML 0.20.0 release brings a number of big changes to its architecture and
a lot of cool new features, some of which are not backwards compatible with
previous versions.

These changes are only covered briefly in the release notes. For a detailed
view on what happened and how you can get the most out of the 0.20.0 release,
please head over to [our "ZenML 0.20.0: Our Biggest Release Yet" blog post](https://blog.zenml.io/zenml-revamped).

## Warning: Breaking Changes

Updating to ZenML 0.20.0 needs to be followed by a migration of your existing
ZenML Stacks and you may also need to make changes to your current ZenML
pipeline code. Please read [the migration guide](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty) carefully and follow the
instructions to ensure a smooth transition. The guide walks you through these
changes and offers instructions on how to migrate your existing ZenML stacks and 
pipelines to the new version with minimal effort and disruption to your existing
workloads.

If you have updated to ZenML 0.20.0 by mistake or are experiencing issues with
the new version, you can always go back to the previous version by using
`pip install zenml==0.13.2` instead of `pip install zenml` when installing
ZenML manually or in your scripts.

## Overview of Changes

* [ZenML takes over the Metadata Store](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty#zenml-takes-over-the-metadata-store-role)
role. All information about your ZenML Stacks, pipelines, and artifacts is now
tracked by ZenML itself directly. If you are currently using remote Metadata
Stores (e.g. deployed in cloud) in your stacks, you will probably need to
replace them with [ZenML cloud deployments](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md).
* the [new ZenML Dashboard](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty#the-zenml-dashboard-is-now-available) is now
available with all ZenML deployments.
* [ZenML Profiles have been removed](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty#removal-of-profiles-and-the-local-yaml-database)
in favor of ZenML Projects. You need to
[manually migrate your existing ZenML Profiles](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty#how-to-migrate-your-profiles)
after the update.
* the [configuration of Stack Components is now decoupled from their implementation](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty#decoupling-stack-component-configuration-from-implementation).
If you extended ZenML with custom stack component implementations, you may need
to update the way they are registered in ZenML.
* the updated ZenML server provides a new and improved collaborative experience.
When connected to a ZenML server, you can now [share your ZenML Stacks and Stack Components](https://docs.zenml.io/guidelines/migration-zero-twenty#shared-zenml-stacks-and-stack-components) with other users. If you were
previously using the ZenML Profiles or the ZenML server to share your ZenML
Stacks, you should switch to the new ZenML server and Dashboard and update your
existing workflows to reflect the new features.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.13.0...0.13.1


# 0.13.0

ZenML version 0.13.0 is chock-full with exciting features. 

[Custom Code Deployment](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/custom_code_deployment) is the
continuation of the Model Deployment story that we have been working on over the last few releases. Now
it is possible to deploy custom code along with your models using Kserve or Seldon.

With [Spark](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/spark_distributed_programming) this 
release also brings distributed processing into the ZenML toolkit.

Spinning up and configuring infrastructure is a difficult part of the MLOps journey 
and can easily become a barrier to entry. Using our [mlops-stacks](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks)
repository, it is now possible to spin up perfectly configured infrastructure with
the corresponding ZenML stack using the ZenML CLI.

As always, we've also included various bug fixes and lots of improvements to the documentation and our examples.

## Breaking Changes

This release introduces a breaking change to the CLI by adjusting the access to
the stack component specific resources for `secret-managers` and 
`model-deployers` to be more explicitly linked to the component. Here is how:

```bash
# `zenml secret register ...` becomes 
zenml secrets-manager secret register ...

# `zenml served_models list` becomes 
zenml model-deployer models list
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.12.0...0.13.0


# 0.12.0

The 0.12.0 release comes with the third implementation of the ZenML Model Deployer abstraction: 
The [KServe](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/kserve_deployment) 
integration allows you to deploy any PyTorch, TensorFlow or SKLearn from within your ZenML pipelines!

We also added functionality to specify hardware resources on a step level to control the amount of memory, CPUs and GPUs that
each ZenML step has access to. This is currently limited to the Kubeflow and Vertex orchestrator but will be expanded in upcoming releases.

Additionally, we've added support for scoped secrets in our AWS, GCP and Vault Secrets Managers. These updated Secrets Managers allow
you to configure a scope which determines if secrets are shared with other ZenML Secrets Managers using the same backend.

As always, we've also included various bug fixes and lots of improvements to the documentation and our examples.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.11.0...0.12.0


# 0.11.0

Our 0.11.0 release contains our new annotation workflow and stack component. We've been blogging about this for a few weeks, and even started maintaining our own repository of open-source annotation tools. With ZenML 0.11.0 you can bring data labeling into your MLOps pipelines and workflows as a first-class citizen. We've started our first iteration of this functionality by integrating with [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/), a leader in the open-source annotation tool space.

This release also includes a ton of updates to our documentation. (Seriously, go check them out! We added tens of thousands of words since the last release.) We continued the work on our data validation story from the previous release: [Deepchecks](https://deepchecks.com/) is the newest data validator we support, and we updated our Evidently and Whylogs integrations to include all the latest and greatest from those tools.

Beyond this, as usual we included a number of smaller bugfixes and documentation changes to cumulatively improve experience of using ZenML as a user. For a detailed look at what's changed, give [our full release notes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/tag/0.11.0) a glance.

## Breaking Changes

The 0.11.0 release remodels the Evidently and whylogs integrations as Data Validator stack components, in an effort to converge all data profiling and validation libraries around the same abstraction. As a consequence, you now need to configure and add a Data Validator stack component to your stack if you wish to use Evidently or whylogs in your pipelines:

* for Evidently:

    ```shell
    zenml data-validator register evidently -f evidently
    zenml stack update -dv evidently
    ```

* for whylogs:

    ```shell
    zenml data-validator register whylogs -f whylogs
    zenml stack update -dv whylogs
    ```

In this release, we have also upgraded the Evidently and whylogs libraries to their latest and greatest versions (whylogs 1.0.6 and evidently 0.1.52). These versions introduce non-backwards compatible changes that are also reflected in the ZenML integrations:

* Evidently profiles are now materialized using their original `evidently.model_profile.Profile ` data type and the builtin `EvidentlyProfileStep` step now also returns a `Profile` instance instead of the previous dictionary representation. This may impact your existing pipelines as you may have to update your steps to take in `Profile` artifact instances instead of dictionaries.

* the whylogs `whylogs.DatasetProfile` data type was replaced by `whylogs.core.DatasetProfileView` in the builtin whylogs materializer and steps. This may impact your existing pipelines as you may have to update your steps to return and take in `whylogs.core.DatasetProfileView` artifact instances instead of `whylogs.DatasetProfile` objects.

* the whylogs library has gone through a major transformation that completely removed the session concept. As a result, the `enable_whylogs` step decorator was replaced by an `enable_whylabs` step decorator. You only need to use the step decorator if you wish to log your profiles to the Whylabs platform.

Pleaser refer to the examples provided for Evidently and whylogs to learn more about how to use the new integration versions:

* [Evidently](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/evidently_drift_detection)
* [whylogs/Whylabs](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/whylogs_data_profiling)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.10.0...0.11.0

# 0.10.0

The 0.10.0 release continues our streak of extending ZenML with support for new
orchestrators, this time by adding
[the Kubernetes Native Orchestrator](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/kubernetes_orchestration).
This orchestrator is a lightweight alternative to other distributed orchestrators
like Airflow or Kubeflow that gives our users the ability to run pipelines in any
Kubernetes cluster without having to install and manage additional tools or
components. 

This release features another integration that we are really excited about: the
popular data profiling and validation library [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/)
is our first Data Validator, a new category of stack components that we are in
the process of standardizing, that will make data quality a central feature of
ZenML. [The ZenML Great Expectations integration](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/great_expectations_data_validation)
eliminates the complexity associated with configuring the store backends for
Great Expectations by reusing our Artifact Store concept for that purpose and
gives ZenML users immediate access to Great Expectations in both local and cloud
settings.

Last but not least, the release also includes a new secrets manager implementation,
courtesy of our contributor @karimhabush, that integrates ZenML with the
[Hashicorp Vault Server](https://www.vaultproject.io) as well as a few other bug
fixes and improvements.

# 0.9.0

It's been a couple of weeks, so it's time for a new release! 0.9.0 brings two whole new orchestrators, one of which was contributed by a community member just one day after we unveiled new documentation for orchestrator extensibility! The release also includes a new secrets manager, a Slack integration and a bunch of other smaller changes across the codebase. (Our new orchestrators are exciting enough that they'll get their own blog posts to showcase their strengths in due course.)

Beyond this, as usual we included a number of smaller bugfixes and documentation changes to cumulatively improve experience of using ZenML as a user.

# 0.7.3

## 📊 Experiment Tracking Components

[PR #530](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/530) adds a new stack component to ZenMLs ever-growing list:  `experiment_trackers` allows users to configure your experiment tracking tools with ZenML. Examples of experiment tracking tools are [Weights&Biases](https://wandb.ai), [mlflow](https://mlflow.org), [Neptune](https://neptune.ai), amongst others.

Existing users might be confused, as ZenML has had MLflow and wandb support for a while now without such a component. However, this component allows uses more control over the configuration of MLflow and wandb with the new `MLFlowExperimentTracker` and 
 `WandbExperimentTracker` components. This allows these tools to work in more scenarios than the currently limiting local use-cases.

## 🔎 XGBoost and LightGBM support

[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/) are one of the most widely used boosting algorithm libraries out there. This release adds materializers for native objects for each library.

Check out [both examples here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples) and PR's [#544](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/544) and [#538](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/538) for more details.

## 📂 Parameterized S3FS support to enable non-AWS S3 storage (minio, ceph)

A big complaint of the [S3 Artifact Store](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/s3/artifact_stores/s3_artifact_store.py) integration was that it was hard to parameterize it in a way that it supports non-AWS S3 storage like [minio](https://min.io/) and [ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/s3/). The latest release 
 made this super simple! When you want to register an S3ArtifactStore from the CLI, you can now pass in  `client_kwargs`, `config_kwargs` or `s3_additional_kwargs` as a JSON string. For example:

```shell
zenml artifact-store register my_s3_store --type=s3 --path=s3://my_bucket \
    --client_kwargs='{"endpoint_url": "http://my-s3-endpoint"}'
```

See PR [#532](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/532) for more details.

## 🧱 New CLI commands to update stack components

We added functionality to allow users to update stacks that already exist. This shows the basic workflow:

```shell
zenml orchestrator register local_orchestrator2 -t local
zenml stack update default -o local_orchestrator2
zenml stack describe default
zenml container-registry register local_registry --type=default --uri=localhost:5000
zenml container-registry update local --uri='somethingelse.com'
zenml container-registry rename local local2
zenml container-registry describe local2
zenml stack rename default new_default
zenml stack update new_default -c local2
zenml stack describe new_default
zenml stack remove-component -c
```
More details are in the [CLI docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/0.7.3/cli/). 
Users can add new stack components to a pre-existing stack, or they can modify 
already-present stack components. They can also rename their stack and individual stack components.

## 🐛 Seldon Core authentication through ZenML secrets

The Seldon Core Model Deployer stack component was updated in this release to allow the configuration of ZenML secrets with credentials that authenticate Seldon to access the Artifact Store. The Seldon Core integration provides 3 different secret schemas for the 3 flavors of Artifact Store: AWS, GCP, and Azure, but custom secrets can be used as well. For more information on how to use this feature please refer to our [Seldon Core deployment example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/seldon_deployment).

Lastly, we had numerous other changes such as ensuring the PyTorch materializer works across all artifact stores 
and the Kubeflow Metadata Store can be easily queried locally.

# 0.7.2

0.7.2 is a minor release which quickly patches some bugs found in the last
release to do with Seldon and Mlflow deployment.

This release also features initial versions of two amazing new integrations:
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and [Weights&Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)!

- HuggingFace models are now supported to be passed through ZenML pipelines!
- You can now track your pipeline runs with Weights&Biases with the new
`enable_wandb` decorator!

Continuous model deployment with MLflow has been improved with ZenML 0.7.2. A new
MLflow Model Deployer Stack component is now available and needs to be part of
your stack to be able to deploy models:

```bash
zenml integration install mlflow
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --type=mlflow
zenml stack register local_with_mlflow -m default -a default -o default -d mlflow
zenml stack set local_with_mlflow
```

The MLflow Model Deployer is yet another addition to the list of Model Deployers
available in ZenML. You can read more on deploying models to production with MLflow
in our [Continuous Training and Deployment documentation section](https://docs.zenml.io/advanced-guide/practical/deploying-models) and 
our [MLflow deployment example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/mlflow_deployment).

# 0.7.1

The release introduces the [Seldon Core](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core) ZenML integration, featuring the
*Seldon Core Model Deployer* and a *Seldon Core standard model deployer step*.
The [*Model Deployer*](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/model-deployers/model-deployers)
is a new type of stack component that enables you to develop continuous
model deployment pipelines that train models and continuously deploy them to an
external model serving tool, service or platform. You can read more on deploying models
to production with Seldon Core in our
[Continuous Training and Deployment documentation section](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/model-deployers/model-deployers) and our [Seldon Core deployment example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/seldon_deployment).

We also see two new integrations with [Feast](https://feast.dev) as ZenML's first feature store integration. Feature stores allow data teams to serve data via an offline store and an online low-latency store where data is kept in sync between the two. It also offers a centralized registry where features (and feature schemas) are stored for use within a team or wider organization. ZenML now supports connecting to a Redis-backed Feast feature store as a stack component integration. Check out the [full example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/release/0.7.1/examples/feature_store) to see it in action! 

0.7.1 also brings  an addition to ZenML training library integrations with [NeuralProphet](https://neuralprophet.com/html/index.html). Check out the new [example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples) for more details, and the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io) for more further detail on all new features!

# 0.7.0

With ZenML 0.7.0, a lot has been revamped under the hood about how things are stored. Importantly what this means is that ZenML now has system-wide profiles that let you register stacks to share across several of your projects! If you still want to manage your stacks for each project folder individually, profiles still let you do that as well.

Most projects of any complexity will require passwords or tokens to access data and infrastructure, and for this purpose ZenML 0.7.0 introduces [the Secrets Manager](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/secrets-managers/secrets-managers) stack component to seamlessly pass around these values to your steps. Our AWS integration also allows you to use AWS Secrets Manager as a backend to handle all your secret persistence needs.

Finally, in addition to the new AzureML and Sagemaker Step Operators that version 0.6.3 brought, this release also adds the ability to [run individual steps on GCP's Vertex AI](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/step-operators/gcloud-vertexai).

Beyond this, some smaller bugfixes and documentation changes combine to make ZenML 0.7.0 a more pleasant user experience.

# 0.6.3

With ZenML 0.6.3, you can now run your ZenML steps on Sagemaker and AzureML! It's normal to have certain steps that require specific hardware on which to run model training, for example, and this latest release gives you the power to switch out hardware for individual steps to support this.

We added a new Tensorboard visualization that you can make use of when using our Kubeflow Pipelines integration. We handle the background processes needed to spin up this interactive web interface that you can use to visualize your model's performance over time.

Behind the scenes we gave our integration testing suite a massive upgrade, fixed a number of smaller bugs and made documentation updates. For a detailed look at what's changed, give [our full release notes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/tag/0.6.3) a glance.

# 0.6.2

ZenML 0.6.2 brings you the ability to serve models using MLflow deployments as well as an updated CLI interface! For a real continuous deployment cycle, we know that ZenML pipelines should be able to handle everything — from pre-processing to training to serving to monitoring and then potentially re-training and re-serving. The interfaces we created in this release are the foundation on which all of this will build.

We also improved how you interact with ZenML through the CLI. Everything looks so much smarter and readable now with the popular `rich` library integrated into our dependencies.

Smaller changes that you'll notice include updates to our cloud integrations and bug fixes for Windows users. For a detailed look at what's changed, see below.

# 0.6.0

ZenML 0.6.0 is out now. We've made some big changes under the hood, but our biggest public-facing addition is our new integration to support all your data logging needs: [`whylogs`](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs). Our core architecture was [thoroughly reworked](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/305) and is now in a much better place to support our ongoing development needs.


Smaller changes that you'll notice include extensive documentation additions, updates and fixes. For a detailed look at what's changed, see below.

## 📊 Whylogs logging

[Whylogs](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs) is an open source library that analyzes your data and creates statistical summaries called whylogs profiles. Whylogs profiles can be visualized locally or uploaded to the WhyLabs platform where more comprehensive analysis can be carried out.

ZenML integrates seamlessly with Whylogs and [WhyLabs](https://whylabs.ai/). This example shows how easy it is to enhance steps in an existing ML pipeline with Whylogs profiling features. Changes to the user code are minimal while ZenML takes care of all aspects related to Whylogs session initialization, profile serialization, versioning and persistence and even uploading generated profiles to [Whylabs](https://whylabs.ai/).

![Example of the visualizations you can make from Whylogs profiles](https://blog.zenml.io/assets/posts/release_0_6_0/whylogs-visualizer.png)

With our `WhylogsVisualizer`, as described in [the associated example notes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/whylogs), you can visualize Whylogs profiles generated as part of a pipeline.

## ⛩ New Core Architecture

We implemented [some fundamental changes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/305) to the core architecture to solve some of the issues we previously had and provide a more extensible design to support quicker implementations of different stack components and integrations. The main change was to refactor the `Repository`, `Stack` and `StackComponent` architectures. These changes had a pretty wide impact so involved changes in many files throughout the codebase, especially in the CLI which makes calls to all these pieces.

We've already seen how it helps us move faster in building integrations and we hope it helps making contributions as pain-free as possible!

## 🗒 Documentation and Example Updates

As the codebase and functionality of ZenML grows, we always want to make sure our documentation is clear, up-to-date and easy to use. We made a number of changes in this release that will improve your experience in this regard:

- added a number of new explainers on key ZenML concepts and how to use them in your code, notably on [how to create a custom materializer](https://docs.zenml.io/v/0.6.0/guides/index/custom-materializer) and [how to fetch historic pipeline runs](https://docs.zenml.io/v/0.6.0/guides/index/historic-runs) using the `StepContext`
- fixed a number of typos and broken links
- [added versioning](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/336) to our API documentation so you can choose to view the reference appropriate to the version that you're using. We now use `mkdocs` for this so you'll notice a slight visual refresh as well.
- added new examples highlighting specific use cases and integrations:
	- how to create a custom materializer ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/custom_materializer))
	- how to fetch historical pipeline runs ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/fetch_historical_runs))
	- how to use standard interfaces for common ML patterns ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/standard_interfaces))
	- `whylogs` logging ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/whylogs))

## ➕ Other updates, additions and fixes

As with most releases, we made a number of small but significant fixes and additions. The most import of these were that you can now [access the metadata store](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/338) via the step context. This enables a number of new possible workflows and pipeline patterns and we're really excited to have this in the release.

We [added in](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/315) a markdown parser for the `zenml example info …` command, so now when you want to use our CLI to learn more about specific examples you will see beautifully parsed text and not markdown markup.

We improved a few of our error messages, too, like for when the return type of a step function [doesn’t match the expected type](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/322), or if [step is called twice](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/353). We hope this makes ZenML just that little bit easier to use.

# 0.5.7

ZenML 0.5.7 is here  :100:  and it brings not one, but :fire:TWO:fire: brand new integrations :rocket:! ZenML now support [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) for tracking pipelines as experiments and [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) for detecting drift in your ML pipelines in production!

## New Features
* Introducing the [MLFlow Tracking](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) Integration, a first step towards 
our complete MLFlow Integration as described in the [#115 poll](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/discussions/115). 
Full example found [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.5.7/examples/mlflow).
* Introducing the [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) integration. Use the standard 
[Evidently drift detection step](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/0.5.7/src/zenml/integrations/evidently/steps/evidently_profile.py) 
to calculate drift automatically in your pipeline. Full example found [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.5.7/examples/drift_detection).

This release fixes some known bugs from previous releases and especially 0.5.5. Therefore, upgrading to 0.5.6 is a **breaking change**. You must do the following in order to proceed with this version:

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf .zen/
```

And then start again with ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
zenml init
```

## New Features
* Added `zenml example run [EXAMPLE_RUN_NAME]` feature: The ability to run an example with one command. In order to run this, do `zenml example pull` first and see all examples available by running `zenml example list`.
* Added ability to specify a `.dockerignore` file before running pipelines on Kubeflow.
* Kubeflow Orchestrator is now leaner and faster. 
* Added the `describe` command group to the CLI for groups `stack`, `orchestrator`, `artifact-store`, and `metadata-store`. E.g. `zenml stack describe`

## Bug fixes and minor improvements
* Adding `StepContext` to a branch now invalidates caching by default. Disable explicitly with `enable_cache=True`.
* Docs updated to reflect minor changes in CLI commands.
* CLI `list` commands now mentions active component. Try `zenml stack list` to check this out.
* `zenml version` now has cooler art.

[Our roadmap](https://zenml.hellonext.co/roadmap) goes into further detail on the timeline. Vote on the [next features now](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/discussions).

We encourage every user (old or new) to start afresh with this release. Please go over our latest [docs](https://docs.zenml.io) and [examples](examples) to get a hang of the new system.


# 0.5.0
This long-awaited ZenML release marks a seminal moment in the project's history. We present to you a complete 
revamp of the internals of ZenML, with a fresh new design and API. While these changes are significant, and have been months 
in the making, the original vision of ZenML has not wavered. We hope that the ZenML community finds the new 
design choices easier to grasp and use, and we welcome feedback on the [issues board](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues).

## Warning
0.5.0 is a complete API change from the previous versions of ZenML, and is a *breaking* upgrade. Fundamental 
concepts have been changed, and therefore backwards compatibility is not maintained. Please use only this version 
with fresh projects.

With such significant changes, we expect this release to also be breaking. Please report any bugs in the issue board, and 
they should be addressed in upcoming releases.

## Overview

* Introducing a new functional API for creating pipelines and steps. This is now the default mechanism for building ZenML pipelines. [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/pipelines/pipelines)
* Steps now use Materializers to handle artifact serialization/deserialization between steps. This is a powerful change, and will be expanded upon in the future. [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/pipelines/materializers)
* Introducing the new `Stack` paradigm: Easily transition from one MLOps stack to the next with a few CLI commands [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/stacks/stacks)
* Introducing a new `Artifact`, `Typing`, and `Annotation` system, with `pydantic` (and `dataclasses`) support [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts)
* Deprecating the `pipelines_dir`: Now individual pipelines will be stored in their metadata stores, making the metadata store a single source of truth. [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts)
* Deprecating the YAML config file: ZenML no longer natively compiles to an intermediate YAML-based representation. Instead, it compiles and deploys directly into the selected orchestrator's 
representation. While we do plan to support running pipelines directly through YAML in the future, it will no longer be
the default route through which pipelines are run. [read more about orchestrators here](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/orchestrators/orchestrators)

## Technical Improvements
* A completely new system design, please refer to the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts).
* Better type hints and docstrings.
* Auto-completion support.
* Numerous performance improvements and bug fixes, including a smaller dependency footprint.

## What to expect in the next weeks and the new ZenML
Currently, this release is bare bones. We are missing some basic features which used to be part of ZenML 0.3.8 (the previous release):

* Standard interfaces for `TrainingPipeline`.
* Individual step interfaces like `PreprocessorStep`, `TrainerStep`, `DeployerStep` etc. need to be rewritten from within the new paradigm. They should
be included in the non-RC version of this release.
* A proper production setup with an orchestrator like Airflow.
* A post-execution workflow to analyze and inspect pipeline runs.
* The concept of `Backends` will evolve into a simple mechanism of transitioning individual steps into different runners.
* Support for `KubernetesOrchestrator`, `KubeflowOrchestrator`, `GCPOrchestrator` and `AWSOrchestrator` are also planned.
* Dependency management including Docker support is planned.

[Our roadmap](https://zenml.hellonext.co/roadmap) goes into further detail on the timeline.

We encourage every user (old or new) to start afresh with this release. Please go over our latest [docs](https://docs.zenml.io) 
and [examples](examples) to get a hang of the new system.

Onwards and upwards to 1.0.0!

# 0.3.7.1
This release fixes some known bugs from previous releases and especially 0.3.7. Same procedure as always, please delete existing pipelines, metadata, and artifact stores.

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf pipelines/
rm -rf .zenml/
```

And then another ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
cd zenml_enabled_repo
zenml init
```

## New Features
* Introduced new `zenml example` CLI sub-group: Easily pull examples via zenml to check it out.

```bash
zenml example pull # pulls all examples in `zenml_examples` directory
zenml example pull EXAMPLE_NAME  # pulls specific example
zenml example info EXAMPLE_NAME  # gives quick info regarding example
```  
Thanks Michael Xu for the suggestion!

* Updated examples with new `zenml examples` paradigm for examples.

## Bug Fixes + Refactor

* ZenML now works on Windows -> Thank you @Franky007Bond for the heads up.
* Updated numerous bugs in examples directory. Also updated README's.
* Fixed remote orchestration logic -> Now remote orchestration works.
* Changed datasource `to_config` to include reference to backend, metadata, and artifact store.


# 0.3.7
0.3.7 is a much-needed, long-awaited, big refactor of the Datasources paradigm of ZenML. There are also bug fixes, improvements, and more!

For those upgrading from an older version of ZenML, we ask to please delete their old `pipelines` dir and `.zenml` folders and start afresh with a `zenml init`.

If only working locally, this is as simple as:

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf pipelines/
rm -rf .zenml/
```

And then another ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
cd zenml_enabled_repo
zenml init
```

## New Features
* The inner-workings of the `BaseDatasource` have been modified along with the concrete implementations. Now, there is no relation between a `DataStep` and a `Datasource`: A `Datasource` holds all the logic to version and track itself via the new `commit` paradigm.

* Introduced a new interface for datasources, the `process` method which is responsible for ingesting data and writing to TFRecords to be consumed by later steps.

* Datasource versions (snapshots) can be accessed directly via the `commits` paradigm: Every commit is a new version of data.

* Added `JSONDatasource` and `TFRecordsDatasource`.

## Bug Fixes + Refactor
A big thanks to our new contributor @aak7912 for the help in this release with issue #71 and PR #75.

* Added an example for [regression](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/regression).
* `compare_training_runs()` now takes an optional `datasource` parameter to filter by datasource.
* `Trainer` interface refined to focus on `run_fn` rather than other helper functions.
* New docs released with a streamlined vision and coherent storyline: https://docs.zenml.io
* Got rid of unnecessary Torch dependency with base ZenML version.


# 0.3.6
0.3.6 is a more inwards-facing release as part of a bigger effort to create a more flexible ZenML. As a first step, ZenML now supports arbitrary splits for all components natively, freeing us from the `train/eval` split paradigm. Here is an overview of changes:

## New Features
* The inner-workings of the `BaseTrainerStep`, `BaseEvaluatorStep` and the `BasePreprocessorStep` have been modified along with their respective components to work with the new split_mapping. Now, users can define arbitrary splits (not just train/eval). E.g. Doing a `train/eval/test` split is possible.

* Within the instance of a `TrainerStep`, the user has access to `input_patterns` and `output_patterns` which provide the required uris with respect to their splits for the input and output(test_results) examples.

* The built-in trainers are modified to work with the new changes.

## Bug Fixes + Refactor
A big thanks to our new super supporter @zyfzjsc988 for most of the feedback that led to bug fixes and enhancements for this release: 

* #63: Now one can specify which ports ZenML opens its add-on applications.
* #64 Now there is a way to list integrations with the following code:
```
from zenml.utils.requirements_utils import list_integrations.
list_integrations()
```
* Fixed #61: `view_anomalies()` breaking in the quickstart.
* Analytics is now `opt-in` by default, to get rid of the unnecessary prompt at `zenml init`. Users can still freely `opt-out` by using the CLI:

```
zenml config analytics opt-out
```

Again, the telemetry data is fully anonymized and just used to improve the product. Read more [here](https://docs.zenml.io/misc/usage-analytics)

# 0.3.5

## New Features
* Added a new interface into the trainer step called [`test_fn`]() which is utilized to produce model predictions and save them as test results

* Implemented a new evaluator step called [`AgnosticEvaluator`]() which is designed to work regardless of the model type as long as you run the `test_fn` in your trainer step

* The first two changes allow torch trainer steps to be followed by an agnostic evaluator step, see the example [here]().

* Proposed a new naming scheme, which is now integrated into the built-in steps, in order to make it easier to handle feature/label names

* Implemented a new adapted version of 2 TFX components, namely the [`Trainer`]() and the [`Evaluator`]() to allow the aforementioned changes to take place

* Modified the [`TorchFeedForwardTrainer`]() to showcase how to use TensorBoard in conjunction with PyTorch


## Bug Fixes + Refactor
* Refactored how ZenML treats relative imports for custom steps. Now:
```python

```

* Updated the [Scikit Example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/scikit), [PyTorch Lightning Example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/pytorch_lightning), [GAN Example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/gan) accordingly. Now they should work according to their README's.

Big shout out to @SarahKing92 in issue #34 for raising the above issues!


# 0.3.4
This release is a big design change and refactor. It involves a significant change in the Configuration file structure, meaning this is a **breaking upgrade**. 
For those upgrading from an older version of ZenML, we ask to please delete their old `pipelines` dir and `.zenml` folders and start afresh with a `zenml init`.

If only working locally, this is as simple as:

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf pipelines/
rm -rf .zenml/
```

And then another ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
cd zenml_enabled_repo
zenml init
```

## New Features
* Introduced another higher-level pipeline: The [NLPPipeline](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/zenml/pipelines/nlp_pipeline.py). This is a generic 
  NLP pipeline for a text-datasource based training task. Full example of how to use the NLPPipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/nlp)
* Introduced a [BaseTokenizerStep](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/zenml/steps/tokenizer/base_tokenizer.py) as a simple mechanism to define how to train and encode using any generic 
tokenizer (again for NLP-based tasks).

## Bug Fixes + Refactor
* Significant change to imports: Now imports are way simpler and user-friendly. E.g. Instead of:
```python
from zenml.core.pipelines.training_pipeline import TrainingPipeline
```

A user can simple do:

```python
from zenml.pipelines import TrainingPipeline
```

The caveat is of course that this might involve a re-write of older ZenML code imports.

Note: Future releases are also expected to be breaking. Until announced, please expect that upgrading ZenML versions may cause older-ZenML 
generated pipelines to behave unexpectedly.
