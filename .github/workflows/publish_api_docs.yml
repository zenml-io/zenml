      # IMPORTANT: there's a strategy to installing integrations here in a way
      # that avoids conflicts while at the same time making it possible for all
      # ZenML Python modules to be imported, especially the integration modules:
      # 1. install zenml with all extras with poetry
      # 2. install more restrictive integrations first: feast, seldon and
      # label_studio are currently the ones known to be very restrictive in
      # terms of what versions of dependencies they require
      # 3. install the rest of the integrations
      # 4. as the last step, install zenml again (step 1. repeated)
