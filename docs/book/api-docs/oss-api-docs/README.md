# About

### Getting Started

To begin using the ZenML Server API, follow these simple steps:

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have an active ZenML server or workspace configured.
2. **Authentication**: Obtain an API token from your service account, as detailed in our core documentation.
3. **API Access**: Use the token to authenticate and start interacting with the API endpoints.

### API Endpoints Overview

The API provides several endpoints to facilitate different operations such as:

* **Pipelines**: Create, list, and manage your pipelines.
* **Stacks**: Access and configure stack components, such as orchestrators, artifact stores, and more.
* **Monitoring**: Retrieve logs and metrics to monitor the health of your operations.

### Use Cases

While the ZenML Python SDK covers most workflow requirements, the Server API offers additional utility for:

* Automated scaling of operations in production environments.
* Integration with external monitoring and logging systems.
* Programmatic management and audit of resources and configurations.

By leveraging the Server API, users can enhance the robustness and control of their machine learning workflows, ensuring operations are both efficient and scalable.
