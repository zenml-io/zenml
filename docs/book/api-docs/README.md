# Introduction

## ZenML API Documentation

Welcome to the ZenML API documentation. This guide provides information about both the open-source (OSS) and Pro API endpoints available in the ZenML platform.

## Use Cases

While the ZenML Python SDK covers most workflow requirements, the Server API offers additional utility for:

* Automated scaling of operations in production environments.
* Integration with external monitoring and logging systems.
* Programmatic management and audit of resources and configurations.
* Enterprise team management and access control (Pro).

By leveraging the ZenML API, users can enhance the robustness and control of their machine learning workflows, ensuring operations are both efficient and scalable.
