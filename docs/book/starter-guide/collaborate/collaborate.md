Collaboration is a crucial aspect of any MLOps team as they often need to bring 
together individuals with diverse skills and expertise to create a cohesive 
and effective workflow for machine learning projects. A successful MLOps team 
requires seamless collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and DevOps 
professionals to develop, train, deploy, and maintain machine learning models. 
This can be a challenging task as it requires coordination across different 
tools, processes, and frameworks. 

Herein lies one of ZenML's most significant strengths: a collaborative platform 
that extends beyond your team and includes the community. With ZenML, you can 
seamlessly work together with others, sharing resources and insights to achieve 
your common goals.

- With a deployed ZenML instance, users have the ability to create their own 
teams and project structures. They can easily share pipelines, runs, stacks, 
and other resources, streamlining the workflow and promoting teamwork.

- On the flip side, there's the ZenML Hub. Here, you can peruse a collection 
of community-driven solutions, share your own code, and collaborate with 
fellow members of the community.

This section will center on managing users, their roles, and permissions 
within a deployed ZenML instance, as well as exploring how the ZenML Hub 
integrates into the overall workflow.
