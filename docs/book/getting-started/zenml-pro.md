# ☁️ ZenML Pro

The Pro version of ZenML comes with a number of features that expand the
functionality of the Open Source product

### Role-based access control and permissions

Utilizing ZenML Pro provides you with access to a robust control plane that
unifies user management and optimizes your workflows. Efficiently manage access
and permissions through centralized user administration. Create fine-grained
permissions for resources such as stacks, pipelines, models, etc.

See the section on [user management](./user-management.md) to learn more.

### A brand-new, modern MLOps experience

We have built the ZenML Pro experience from the ground-up. With ZenML Pro, you get
access to a new dashboard, with a better experience. The new dashboard features
more functionality such as
the [Model Control Plane](../../user-guide/starter-guide/track-ml-models.md)
and [Artifact Control Plane](../../user-guide/starter-guide/manage-artifacts.md).

### Run templates for running your pipelines from the dashboard or the API

ZenML Pro enables you to [create and run templates](../../how-to/trigger-pipelines/README.md#run-templates).
This way, you can use the dashboard or our Client/REST API to run a pipeline with updated configuration
which allows you to iterate quickly with minimal friction. 

### Triggers, CI/CD, Reports and more

Additionally, ZenML Pro users get exclusive access to an array of
cloud-specific features, such as triggers, integrating with your code
repository CI/CD system, generating usage reports and more.

### Managed ZenML Server (Multi-tenancy)

ZenML Pro (SaaS solution) simplifies your machine learning workflows, enabling you to deploy a
managed instance of ZenML servers with just one click. This eradicates the need
to handle infrastructure complexities, making the set-up and management of your
machine learning pipelines a breeze. We handle all pertinent system updates and
backups, thus ensuring your system stays current and robust, allowing you to
zero in on your essential MLOps tasks. As a ZenML Pro user, you'll also have
priority support, giving you the necessary aid to fully utilize the platform.

### Maximum data security

At ZenML Pro, your data security and privacy are our top priority. The
platform enables a secure connection to your infrastructure, tracking only
metadata via an encrypted connection to maintain the confidentiality of your
sensitive information. ZenML Pro integrates smoothly with your cloud services
via service connectors, allowing a straightforward connection with various cloud
resources without sacrificing data security. We hold your confidential
information in a secure and isolated environment, offering an extra degree of
protection. If desired, you can
even [supply your own secret store](../deploying-zenml/manage-the-deployed-services/custom-secret-stores.md).

for you to dedicate time and resources to deploy and manage a ZenML server,
allowing you to focus primarily on your MLOps workflows.
