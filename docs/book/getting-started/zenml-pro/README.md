# ☁️ ZenML Pro

The Pro version of ZenML comes with a number of features that expand the
functionality of the Open Source product

### Role-based access control and permissions

Utilizing ZenML Pro provides you with access to a robust control plane that
unifies user management and optimizes your workflows. Efficiently manage access
and permissions through centralized user administration. Create fine-grained
permissions for resources such as stacks, pipelines, models, etc.

See the section on [user management](./user-management.md) to learn more.

### A brand-new, modern MLOps experience

We have built the ZenML Pro experience from the ground-up. With ZenML Pro, you get
access to a new dashboard, with a better experience. The new dashboard features
more functionality such as
the [Model Control Plane](../../user-guide/starter-guide/track-ml-models.md)
and [Artifact Control Plane](../../user-guide/starter-guide/manage-artifacts.md).

### Pipeline run drafts with easier configuration and faster iteration

ZenML Pro enables you to [create drafts out of past pipeline runs](../../how-to/build-pipelines/create-drafts-out-of-pipeline-runs.md). 
This way, you can use the dashboard to make quick adjustments to your pipeline 
configuration and iterate on your workflows using the same remote stack with 
minimal friction. 

### Triggers, CI/CD, Reports and more

Additionally, ZenML Pro users get exclusive access to an array of
cloud-specific features, such as triggering pipelines directly through the
dashboard, integrating with your code repository CI/CD system, generating usage
reports and more.
