## Key features

ZenML Cloud is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that enhances the
functionalities of the open-source ZenML product. It equips you with a
centralized interface to seamlessly launch and manage ZenML server instances.
While it remains rooted in the robust open-source offering, ZenML Cloud offers
extra features designed to optimize your machine learning workflow.

### Managed ZenML Server (Multi-tenancy)

ZenML Cloud simplifies your machine learning workflows, enabling you to deploy a
managed instance of ZenML servers with just one click. This eradicates the need
to handle infrastructure complexities, making the set-up and management of your
machine learning pipelines a breeze. We handle all pertinent system updates and
backups, thus ensuring your system stays current and robust, allowing you to
zero in on your essential MLOps tasks. As a ZenML Cloud user, you'll also have
priority support, giving you the necessary aid to fully utilize the platform.

### Maximum data security

At ZenML Cloud, your data security and privacy are our top priority. The
platform enables a secure connection to your infrastructure, tracking only
metadata via an encrypted connection to maintain the confidentiality of your
sensitive information. ZenML Cloud integrates smoothly with your cloud services
via service connectors, allowing a straightforward connection with various cloud
resources without sacrificing data security. We hold your confidential
information in a secure and isolated environment, offering an extra degree of
protection. If desired, you can
even [supply your own secret store](../deploying-zenml/manage-the-deployed-services/custom-secret-stores.md).
