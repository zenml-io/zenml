# ZenML Pro Core Concepts

In ZenML Pro, there is a slightly different entity hierarchy as compared to the open-source ZenML
framework. This document walks you through the key differences and new concepts that are only available for Pro users.

The image above shows the hierarchy of concepts in ZenML Pro.

- At the top level is your [**Organization**](./organization.md). An organization is a collection of users, teams, and tenants.
- Each [**Tenant**](./tenants.md) is an isolated deployment of a ZenML server. It contains all the resources for your project or team.
- [**Teams**](./teams.md) are groups of users within an organization. They help in organizing users and managing access to resources.
- **Users** are single individual accounts on a ZenML Pro instance.
- [**Roles**](./roles.md) are used to control what actions users can perform within a tenant or inside an organization.
- [**Templates**](../../how-to/trigger-pipelines/README.md) are pipeline runs that can be re-run with a different configuration.

More details about each of these concepts are available in their linked pages below:
