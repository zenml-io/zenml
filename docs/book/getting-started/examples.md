# ZenML In Code

## ZenML Examples: See how all the integrations work

ZenML has a deep focus on integrations, and navigating the landscape of tools that ZenML supports out-of-the-box 
can be daunting. The [examples](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples) on GitHub are the best way 
to see each integration in action. Go here if you like to learn through tutorials, or are interested in particular integrations.

## ZenBytes: Learn MLOps with ZenML

[ZenBytes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) is a series of short practical
MLOps lessons through ZenML and its various integrations. It is intended for
people looking to learn about MLOps generally, and also for ML practitioners who
want to get started with ZenML.

After you've run and understood the example above, your next port of call
is probably either the [fully-fleshed-out quickstart
example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/quickstart) and
then to look at [the ZenBytes repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes)
and notebooks.

ZenBytes shares a close link to the [Practical MLOps](../advanced-guide/practical/practical-mlops.md) 
section of the docs.

## ZenML Projects: See ZenML in practice

ZenML Projects are production-grade ML use-cases powered by ZenML. They are fully
fleshed out, end-to-end, projects that showcase ZenML's capabilities. They can
also serve as a template from which to start similar projects.

The ZenML Projects project is fully maintained and can be viewed as a sister
repository of ZenML.

Use one of our ZenML Project Templates to generate ready-to-use scaffolding for
your own projects, with everything you need to get started: ZenML steps,
pipelines, stack configurations and other useful resources.

## YouTube Tutorials

If you're a visual learner, then the [official ZenML YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZenML) 
is the place to go. It features tutorials, community meetups, and various other announcements regarding the product.

## Blog

The [ZenML Blog](https://blog.zenml.io/) is regularly updated with in-depth tutorials. 
Filtering with the [zenml tag](https://blog.zenml.io/tag/zenml/) is the best way to find 
relevant tutorials and can be read at your leisure.
