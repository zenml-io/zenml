# Navigate ZenML Resources

The ZenML team and community have put together a list of learning resources that can be used to develop a 
deeper understanding of the framework.

## ZenML Examples: See how all the integrations work

ZenML has a deep focus on integrations, and navigating the landscape of tools that ZenML supports out-of-the-box 
can be daunting. The [examples](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples) on GitHub are the best way 
to see each integration in action. Go here if you like to learn through tutorials, or are interested in particular integrations.

## ZenBytes: Learn MLOps with ZenML

[ZenBytes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) is a series of short practical
MLOps lessons through ZenML and its various integrations. It is intended for
people looking to learn about MLOps generally, and also for ML practitioners who
want to get started with ZenML.

After you've run and understood the example above, your next port of call
is probably either the [fully-fleshed-out quickstart
example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/quickstart) and
then to look at [the ZenBytes repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes)
and notebooks.

## ZenFiles: See ZenML in practice

ZenFiles are production-grade ML use-cases powered by ZenML. They are fully
fleshed out, end-to-end, projects that showcase ZenML's capabilities. They can
also serve as a template from which to start similar projects.

The ZenFiles project is fully maintained and can be viewed as a sister
repository of ZenML.

## YouTube Channel: Video tutorials 

The ZenML [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi79n61eV2sVyYxJOqk\_bMw) features a growing set of videos that take you through the entire framework. Go here if you are a visual learner, and follow along some of the tutorials.

## Slack Channel: Get help from the community 

The ZenML [Slack Channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite) is the main gathering point for the community. Not only is it the best place to get in touch with the core team of ZenML, it is also a great way to discuss new ideas and share your own ZenML projects with the community. If you have a question, there is a high chance someone else might have already answered it on Slack!
