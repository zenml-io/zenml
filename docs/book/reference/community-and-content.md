# Community & content

The ZenML team and community have put together a list of references that can be used to get in touch with the
development team of ZenML and develop a deeper understanding of the framework.

### Slack Channel: Get help from the community

The ZenML [Slack channel](https://zenml.io/slack) is the main gathering point for the community. Not only is it
the best place to get in touch with the core team of ZenML, but it is also a great way to discuss new ideas and share
your ZenML projects with the community. If you have a question, there is a high chance someone else might have already
answered it on Slack!

### Social Media: Bite-sized updates

We are active on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/company/zenml/) and Twitter / X (@zenml_io) where
we post bite-sized updates on releases, events, and MLOps in general. Follow us to interact and stay up to date! We
would appreciate it if you could comment on and share our posts so more people can benefit from our work at ZenML!

### YouTube Channel: Video tutorials, workshops, and more

Our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZenML) features a growing set of videos that take you through the entire
framework. Go here if you are a visual learner, and follow along with some tutorials.

### Public roadmap

The feedback from our community plays a significant role in the development of ZenML. That's why we have
a [public roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) that serves as a bridge between our users and our development
team. If you have ideas regarding any new features or want to prioritize one over the other, feel free to share your
thoughts here or vote on existing ideas.

### Blog

On our [Blog](https://zenml.io/blog/) page, you can find various articles written by our team. We use it as a platform
to share our thoughts and explain the implementation process of our tool, its new features, and the thought process
behind them.

### Podcast

We also have a [Podcast](https://podcast.zenml.io/) series that brings you interviews and discussions with industry
leaders, top technology professionals, and others. We discuss the latest developments in machine learning, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on MLOps, or how trained models are used in production.

### Newsletter

You can also subscribe to our [Newsletter](https://zenml.io/newsletter-signup) where we share what we learn as we develop
open-source tooling for production machine learning. You will also get all the exciting news about ZenML in general.
