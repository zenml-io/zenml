# Develop a Custom Feature Store

Feature stores allow data teams to serve data via an offline store, and an online low-latency store where data is kept
in sync between the two. It also offers a centralized registry where features (and feature schemas) are stored for use
within a team or wider organization.

**Base abstraction in progress!**

We are actively working on the base abstraction for the feature stores, which will be available soon. As a result, their
extension is not possible at the moment. If you would like to use a feature store in your stack, please check the list
of already available feature stores down below.
