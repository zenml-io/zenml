# Use the ZenML VSCode extension to manage your ZenML server

The ZenML VSCode extension is a tool that allows you to manage your ZenML server
from within VSCode. It provides features for stack management, pipeline
visualization, and project management capabilities. You can use it in any IDE
which allows the installation of extensions from the VSCode Marketplace, which
means that Cursor also supports this extension.
