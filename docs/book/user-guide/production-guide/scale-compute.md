# Scale compute

{% hint style="warning" %}
We're still working on finishing this easy-to-consume Production Guide for you. In the meanwhile,, please follow the provided links in this space as an interim guide.
{% endhint %}

This section of the production guide will be about scaling compute to the cloud. Until this section is ready, here are some useful links to achieve this goal:

- [The step operator in ZenML](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/step-operators/step-operators.md)
- [Containerization of a pipeline](../advanced-guide/environment-management/containerize-your-pipeline.md)
- [Specify resource requirements for steps](../advanced-guide/environment-management/scale-compute-to-the-cloud.md)
