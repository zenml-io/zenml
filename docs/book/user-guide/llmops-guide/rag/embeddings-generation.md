# Generating Embeddings for Retrieval

In this section, we'll explore how to generate embeddings for your data to
improve retrieval performance in your RAG pipeline. Embeddings are a crucial
part of the retrieval mechanism in RAG, as they represent the data in a
high-dimensional space where similar items are closer together. By generating
embeddings for your data, you can enhance the retrieval capabilities of your RAG
pipeline and provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries.

{% hint style="info" %} Embeddings are vector representations of data that capture the semantic
meaning and context of the data in a high-dimensional space. They are generated
using machine learning models, such as word embeddings or sentence embeddings,
that learn to encode the data in a way that preserves its underlying structure
and relationships. Embeddings are commonly used in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information
retrieval, to represent textual data in a format that is suitable for
computational processing. {% endhint %}

The whole purpose of the embeddings is to allow us to quickly find the small
chunks that are most relevant to our input query at inference time. An even
simpler way of doing this would be to just to search for some keywords in the
query and hope that they're also represented in the chunks. However, this
approach is not very robust and may not work well for more complex queries or
longer documents. By using embeddings, we can capture the semantic meaning and
context of the data and retrieve the most relevant chunks based on their
similarity to the query.

We're using the `sentence-transformers` library to generate embeddings for our
data. This library provides pre-trained models for generating sentence
embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of the text. It's an open-source
library that is easy to use and provides high-quality embeddings for a wide
range of NLP tasks.

```python
from typing import Annotated, List
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from zenml import ArtifactConfig, log_artifact_metadata, step

@step(enable_cache=False)
def generate_embeddings(
    split_documents: List[str],
) -> Annotated[np.ndarray, ArtifactConfig(name="embeddings")]:
    """Generates embeddings for a list of split documents using a SentenceTransformer model."""
    try:
        model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2")

        log_artifact_metadata(
            artifact_name="embeddings",
            metadata={
                "embedding_type": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2",
                "embedding_dimensionality": 384,
            },
        )
        return model.encode(split_documents)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in generate_embeddings: {e}")
        raise
```

There are smaller embeddings models if we cared a lot about speed, and larger
ones (with more dimensions) if we wanted to boost our ability to retrieve more
relevant chunks. [The model we're using here](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2) is on the smaller side, but it
should work well for our use case. The embeddings generated by this model have a
dimensionality of 384, which means that each embedding is represented as a
384-dimensional vector in the high-dimensional space.

We can use dimensionality reduction functionality in `umap` and `scikit-learn`
to represent the 384 dimensions of our embeddings in two-dimensional space. This
allows us to visualize the embeddings and see how similar chunks are clustered
together based on their semantic meaning and context. We can also use this
visualization to identify patterns and relationships in the data that can help
us
improve the retrieval performance of our RAG pipeline.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import umap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# having loaded our embeddings into the `embeddings` variable

# Dimensionality reduction using t-SNE
def tsne_visualization(embeddings):
    tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
    embeddings_2d = tsne.fit_transform(embeddings)
    return embeddings_2d

# Dimensionality reduction using UMAP
def umap_visualization(embeddings):
    umap_2d = umap.UMAP(n_components=2, random_state=42)
    embeddings_2d = umap_2d.fit_transform(embeddings)
    return embeddings_2d

# Visualize embeddings using t-SNE
tsne_embeddings = tsne_visualization(embeddings)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.scatter(tsne_embeddings[:, 0], tsne_embeddings[:, 1])
plt.title("t-SNE Visualization")
plt.show()

# Visualize embeddings using UMAP
umap_embeddings = umap_visualization(embeddings)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.scatter(umap_embeddings[:, 0], umap_embeddings[:, 1])
plt.title("UMAP Visualization")
plt.show()
```

At a later stage we could add some semantics to the chunks to represent certain
labels or types of documentation to ensure that the semantic meanings are being
represented in our embedding space. For now, this was just to show that you can
visualize the embeddings and see how similar chunks are clustered together based
on their semantic meaning and context.

So this step iterates through all the chunks and generates embeddings
representing each piece of text. These embeddings are then stored as an artifact
in the ZenML artifact store as a NumPy array. We separate this generation from
the point where we upload those embeddings to the vector database to keep the
pipeline modular and flexible; in the future we might want to use a different
vector database so we can just swap out the upload step without having to
re-generate the embeddings.

In the next section, we'll explore how to store these embeddings in a vector
database to enable fast and efficient retrieval of relevant chunks at inference
time.
