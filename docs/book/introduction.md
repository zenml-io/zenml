# ZenML

**ZenML** is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating 
portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines. Built 
for data scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers to collaborate, 
it has a simple, flexible syntax, is **cloud-** and 
**tool-agnostic**, and has interfaces/abstractions that are catered towards 
ML workflows. 

At its core, **ZenML pipelines execute ML-specific workflows** from sourcing
data to splitting, preprocessing, training, all the way to serving and monitoring 
ML models in production. There are many built-in features to support
common ML development tasks. ZenML is not here to replace the great tools that
solve these individual problems. Rather, it offers an **extensible framework** and a
standard abstraction to write and build your workflows.

## **Pipelining** - Take your first ZenML Steps

Every journey has to start somewhere, if you are new to ZenML, you might want to
get acquainted with the [core concepts](core-concepts.md) first, 
to understand what makes ZenML so special. Afterwards, you could jump right 
into our [developer guide](developer-guide/installation.md) that will 
take you from zero to hero in no time and explain the necessary knowledge of 
**how to use ZenML**.

## **Stacking** - Customize your Stack

Already ran your first pipelines and want to know about integrations and
production use cases? Our [Advanced Guides](advanced-guide/integrations.md) are the 
right place for you. You'll find some more detailed descriptions of specific
use cases and features here. This is where you'll learn how to take your 
MLOps stack from basic to fully loaded.

## **Extending** - Make it your own

ZenML does not natively support your favorite tool? Don't you worry! ZenML is 
built from the ground up with extensibility in mind. Find out how to integrate 
other tools or proprietary on-prem solutions for you and your team in our 
section on [Stack Components](advanced-guide/stacks-components-flavors.md). 

## **Collaborating** - Work together with your team

Share not only your code but also your ZenML stacks with your team. Find out how
in our section on [collaboration](collaborate/collaborate-with-zenml.md). 

## **Resources** - Learn ZenML with tutorials, examples, and guides

The ZenML team and community has put together many more resources other than the 
documentation to learn about the framework. Learn more in our section on [resources](resources/index.md).
