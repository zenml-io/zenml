# How Artifact Naming works in ZenML 

In ZenML pipelines, you often need to reuse the same step multiple times with different inputs, resulting in multiple artifacts. However, the default naming convention for artifacts can make it challenging to track and differentiate between these outputs, especially when they need to be used in subsequent pipelines. Below you can find a detailed exploration of how you might name your output artifacts dynamically or statically, depending on your needs.

ZenML uses type annotations in function definitions to determine artifact names. Output artifacts with the same name are saved with incremented version numbers.

ZenML provides flexible options for naming output artifacts, supporting both static and dynamic naming strategies:
- Names can be generated dynamically at runtime
- Support for string templates (standard and custom placeholders supported)
- Compatible with single and multiple output scenarios
- Annotations help define naming strategy without modifying core logic

## Naming Strategies

### Static Naming
Static names are defined directly as string literals.

```python
@step
def static_single() -> Annotated[str, "static_output_name"]:
    return "null"
```

### Dynamic Naming
Dynamic names can be generated using:

#### String Templates Using Standard Placeholders
Use the following placeholders that ZenML will replace automatically:

* `{date}` will resolve to the current date, e.g. `2024_11_18`
* `{time}` will resolve to the current time, e.g. `11_07_09_326492`

```python
@step
def dynamic_single_string() -> Annotated[str, "name_{date}_{time}"]:
    return "null"
```

#### String Templates Using Custom Placeholders
Use any placeholders that ZenML will replace for you, if they are provided into a step via `substitutions` parameter:

```python
@step(substitutions={"custom_placeholder": "some_substitute"})
def dynamic_single_string() -> Annotated[str, "name_{custom_placeholder}_{time}"]:
    return "null"
```

Another option is to use `with_options` to dynamically redefine the placeholder, like this:

```python
@step
def extract_data(source: str) -> Annotated[str, "{stage}_dataset"]:
    ...
    return "my data"

@pipeline
def extraction_pipeline():
    extract_data.with_options(substitutions={"stage": "train"})(source="s3://train")
    extract_data.with_options(substitutions={"stage": "test"})(source="s3://test")
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The substitutions for the custom placeholders like `stage` can be set in:
- `@pipeline` decorator, so they are effective for all steps in this pipeline
- `pipeline.with_options` function, so they are effective for all steps in this pipeline run
- `@step` decorator, so they are effective for this step (this overrides the pipeline settings)
- `step.with_options` function, so they are effective for this step run (this overrides the pipeline settings)

Standard substitutions always available and consistent in all steps of the pipeline are:
- `{date}`: current date, e.g. `2024_11_27`
- `{time}`: current time in UTC format, e.g. `11_07_09_326492`
{% endhint %}

### Multiple Output Handling

If you plan to return multiple artifacts from you ZenML step you can flexibly combine all naming options outlined above, like this:

```python
@step
def mixed_tuple() -> Tuple[
    Annotated[str, "static_output_name"],
    Annotated[str, "name_{date}_{time}"],
]:
    return "static_namer", "str_namer"
```

## Naming in cached runs

If your ZenML step is running with enabled caching and cache was used the names of the outputs artifacts (both static and dynamic) will remain the same as in the original run.

```python
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from typing import Tuple

from zenml import step, pipeline
from zenml.models import PipelineRunResponse


@step(substitutions={"custom_placeholder": "resolution"})
def demo() -> Tuple[
    Annotated[int, "name_{date}_{time}"],
    Annotated[int, "name_{custom_placeholder}"],
]:
    return 42, 43


@pipeline
def my_pipeline():
    demo()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_without_cache: PipelineRunResponse = my_pipeline.with_options(
        enable_cache=False
    )()
    run_with_cache: PipelineRunResponse = my_pipeline.with_options(enable_cache=True)()

    assert set(run_without_cache.steps["demo"].outputs.keys()) == set(
        run_with_cache.steps["demo"].outputs.keys()
    )
    print(list(run_without_cache.steps["demo"].outputs.keys()))
```

These 2 runs will produce output like the one below:
```

Caching is disabled by default for my_pipeline.

  orchestrator: default
