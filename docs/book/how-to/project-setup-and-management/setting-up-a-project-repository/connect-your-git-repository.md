# Connect your git repository

A code repository in ZenML refers to a remote storage location for your code. Some commonly known code repository platforms include [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Remote_with_code_repository.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A visual representation of how the code repository fits into the general ZenML architecture.</p></figcaption></figure>

Code repositories enable ZenML to keep track of the code version that you use for your pipeline runs. Additionally, running a pipeline that is tracked in a registered code repository can [speed up the Docker image building for containerized stack components](../../infrastructure-deployment/customize-docker-builds/use-code-repositories-to-speed-up-docker-build-times.md) by eliminating the need to rebuild Docker images each time you change one of your source code files.

Learn more about how code repositories benefit development [here](../../infrastructure-deployment/customize-docker-builds/use-code-repositories-to-speed-up-docker-build-times.md).

## Registering a code repository

If you are planning to use one of the [available implementations of code repositories](connect-your-git-repository.md#available-implementations), first, you need to install the corresponding ZenML integration:

```
zenml integration install <INTEGRATION_NAME>
```

Afterward, code repositories can be registered using the CLI:

```shell
zenml code-repository register <NAME> --type=<TYPE> [--CODE_REPOSITORY_OPTIONS]
```

For concrete options, check out the section on the [`GitHubCodeRepository`](connect-your-git-repository.md#github), the [`GitLabCodeRepository`](connect-your-git-repository.md#gitlab) or how to develop and register a [custom code repository implementation](connect-your-git-repository.md#developing-a-custom-code-repository).

## Available implementations

ZenML comes with builtin implementations of the code repository abstraction for the `GitHub` and `GitLab` platforms, but it's also possible to use a [custom code repository implementation](connect-your-git-repository.md#developing-a-custom-code-repository).

### GitHub

ZenML provides built-in support for using GitHub as a code repository for your ZenML pipelines. You can register a GitHub code repository by providing the URL of the GitHub instance, the owner of the repository, the name of the repository, and a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with access to the repository.

Before registering the code repository, first, you have to install the corresponding integration:

```sh
zenml integration install github
```

Afterward, you can register a GitHub code repository by running the following CLI command:

```shell
zenml code-repository register <NAME> --type=github \
--url=<GITHUB_URL> --owner=<OWNER> --repository=<REPOSITORY> \
--token=<GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

where \<REPOSITORY> is the name of the code repository you are registering, \<OWNER> is the owner of the repository, \<NAME> is the name of the repository, \<GITHUB\_TOKEN> is your GitHub Personal Access Token and \<GITHUB\_URL> is the URL of the GitHub instance which defaults to `https://github.com.` You will need to set a URL if you are using GitHub Enterprise.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please refer to the section on using secrets for stack configuration in order to securely store your GitHub 
Personal Access Token.

```shell
# Using central secrets management
zenml secret create github_secret \
    --pa_token=<GITHUB_TOKEN>
    
# Then reference the username and password
zenml code-repository register ... --token={{github_secret.pa_token}}
    ...
```
{% endhint %}

After registering the GitHub code repository, ZenML will automatically detect if your source files are being tracked by GitHub and store the commit hash for each pipeline run.

<summary>How to get a token for GitHub</summary>

1. Go to your GitHub account settings and click on [Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
2. Select "Personal access tokens" and click on "Generate new token".
3.  Give your token a name and a description.

4.  We recommend selecting the specific repository and then giving `contents` read-only access.

5.  Click on "Generate token" and copy the token to a safe place.

### GitLab

ZenML also provides built-in support for using GitLab as a code repository for your ZenML pipelines. You can register a GitLab code repository by providing the URL of the GitLab project, the group of the project, the name of the project, and a GitLab Personal Access Token (PAT) with access to the project.

Before registering the code repository, first, you have to install the corresponding integration:

```sh
zenml integration install gitlab
```

Afterward, you can register a GitLab code repository by running the following CLI command:

```shell
zenml code-repository register <NAME> --type=gitlab \
--url=<GITLAB_URL> --group=<GROUP> --project=<PROJECT> \
--token=<GITLAB_TOKEN>
```

where `<NAME>` is the name of the code repository you are registering, `<GROUP>` is the group of the project, `<PROJECT>` is the name of the project, \<GITLAB\_TOKEN> is your GitLab Personal Access Token, and \<GITLAB\_URL> is the URL of the GitLab instance which defaults to `https://gitlab.com.` You will need to set a URL if you have a self-hosted GitLab instance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please refer to the section on using secrets for stack configuration in order to securely store your GitLab
Personal Access Token.

```shell
# Using central secrets management
zenml secret create gitlab_secret \
    --pa_token=<GITLAB_TOKEN>
    
# Then reference the username and password
zenml code-repository register ... --token={{gitlab_secret.pa_token}}
    ...
```
{% endhint %}

After registering the GitLab code repository, ZenML will automatically detect if your source files are being tracked by GitLab and store the commit hash for each pipeline run.

<details>

<summary>How to get a token for GitLab</summary>

1. Go to your GitLab account settings and click on [Access Tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal\_access\_tokens).
2.  Name the token and select the scopes that you need (e.g. `read_repository`, `read_user`, `read_api`)

    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/gitlab-generate-access-token.png)
3.  Click on "Create personal access token" and copy the token to a safe place.

## Developing a custom code repository

If you're using some other platform to store your code, and you still want to use a code repository in ZenML, you can implement and register a custom code repository.

First, you'll need to subclass and implement the abstract methods of the `zenml.code_repositories.BaseCodeRepository` class:

```python
class BaseCodeRepository(ABC):
    """Base class for code repositories."""

    @abstractmethod
    def login(self) -> None:
        """Logs into the code repository."""

    @abstractmethod
    def download_files(
            self, commit: str, directory: str, repo_sub_directory: Optional[str]
    ) -> None:
        """Downloads files from the code repository to a local directory.

        Args:
            commit: The commit hash to download files from.
            directory: The directory to download files to.
            repo_sub_directory: The subdirectory in the repository to
                download files from.
        """

    @abstractmethod
    def get_local_context(
            self, path: str
    ) -> Optional["LocalRepositoryContext"]:
        """Gets a local repository context from a path.

        Args:
            path: The path to the local repository.

        Returns:
            The local repository context object.
        """
```

After you're finished implementing this, you can register it as follows:

```shell
# The `CODE_REPOSITORY_OPTIONS` are key-value pairs that your implementation will receive
# as configuration in its __init__ method. This will usually include stuff like the username
# and other credentials necessary to authenticate with the code repository platform.
zenml code-repository register <NAME> --type=custom --source=my_module.MyRepositoryClass \
    [--CODE_REPOSITORY_OPTIONS]
```
