# Dashboard Features

The ZenML dashboard is a powerful web-based interface that provides visualization, management, and analysis capabilities for your ML workflows. This guide offers a comprehensive overview of the dashboard's features, helping you leverage its full potential for monitoring, managing, and optimizing your machine learning pipelines.

## Introduction

The ZenML dashboard serves as a visual control center for your ML operations, offering intuitive interfaces to navigate pipelines, artifacts, models, and metadata. Whether you're using the open-source version or ZenML Pro, the dashboard provides essential capabilities to enhance your ML workflow management.

## Open Source Dashboard Features

The open-source version of ZenML includes a robust set of dashboard features that provide significant value for individual practitioners and teams.

### Pipeline Visualization

The dashboard renders your pipeline as an interactive Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), making it easy to understand the workflow structure and dependencies between steps.

![Pipeline DAG visualization](../../.gitbook/assets/dashboard-v2-pipeline-dag.png)

This visualization enables you to:
- See the execution flow between pipeline steps
- Identify bottlenecks or failures quickly
- Understand dependencies between different components
- Track pipeline execution status in real-time

```python
from zenml import pipeline

# Pipelines automatically generate visualizations in the dashboard
@pipeline
def my_training_pipeline():
    # Note: load_data, preprocess, train_model, evaluate_model would be custom step functions
    data = load_data()
    processed_data = preprocess(data)
    model = train_model(processed_data)
    evaluate_model(model, processed_data)
```

### Pipeline Run Management

The dashboard maintains a comprehensive history of pipeline runs, allowing you to:

```python
from zenml.client import Client

# Programmatically access pipeline runs that are visible in the dashboard
pipeline_runs = Client().list_pipeline_runs(
    pipeline_name="my_training_pipeline"
)
```

In the dashboard interface, you can:
- Browse through previous executions
- Compare configurations across runs
- Track changes in pipeline structure over time
- Filter runs by status, name, or other attributes

### Stack and Component Management

The dashboard provides a visual interface for managing your ZenML infrastructure through stacks and components. This graphical approach to MLOps infrastructure management simplifies what would otherwise require complex CLI commands or code.

#### Stack Creation and Configuration

Creating ML infrastructure stacks through the dashboard is intuitive and visual. The interface guides you through selecting compatible components and configuring their settings. You can see the entire stack architecture at a glance, making it easier to understand the relationships between different infrastructure pieces.

![Stack management](../../.gitbook/assets/dashboard-v2-stack-management.png)

When building a stack, the dashboard helps you browse available components by category and suggests compatible options. Once created, stacks can be shared with team members, enabling consistent infrastructure across your organization.

#### Component Registration

The dashboard streamlines the process of registering individual components like orchestrators, artifact stores, and container registries. Instead of writing configuration code, you can use form-based interfaces to set up each component.

The UI helps connect components to appropriate service connectors and validates
settings before saving. This visual approach to component management reduces
configuration errors and simplifies the setup process, especially for team
members who may not be familiar with the underlying infrastructure details.
