# Connect with a Personal Access Token

If you are using ZenML Pro and need to call the ZenML Pro workspace API from a non-interactive environment, you create and use a Personal Access Token. Personal Access Tokens are scoped to your ZenML Pro user account and can be used to access all workspaces you are a member of in any organization. See the [ZenML Pro Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.zenml.io/pro/core-concepts/personal-access-tokens) documentation for more information.
