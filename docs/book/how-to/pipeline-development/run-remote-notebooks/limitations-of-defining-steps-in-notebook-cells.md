# Limitations of defining steps in notebook cells

If you want to run ZenML steps defined in notebook cells remotely (either with a remote [orchestrator](../../../component-guide/orchestrators/orchestrators.md) or [step operator](../../../component-guide/step-operators/step-operators.md)), the cells defining your steps must meet the following conditions:
- The cell can only contain python code, no Jupyter magic commands or shell commands starting with a `%` or `!`.
- The cell **must not** call code from other notebook cells. Functions or classes imported from python files are allowed.
- The cell **must not** rely on imports of previous cells. This means your cell must perform all the imports it needs itself, including ZenML imports like `from zenml import step`.
