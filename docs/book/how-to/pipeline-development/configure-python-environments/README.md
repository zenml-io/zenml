# Configure python environments

ZenML deployments often involve multiple environments. This guide helps you manage dependencies and configurations across these environments.

Here is a visual overview of the different environments:

## Client Environment (or the Runner environment)

The client environment (sometimes known as the runner environment) is where the ZenML pipelines are _compiled_, i.e., where you call the pipeline function (typically in a `run.py` script). There are different types of client environments:

* A local development environment
* A CI runner in production.
* A [ZenML Pro](https://zenml.io/pro) runner.
* A `runner` image orchestrated by the ZenML server to start pipelines.

In all the environments, you should use your preferred package manager (e.g., `pip` or `poetry`) to manage dependencies. Ensure you install the ZenML package and any required [integrations](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks).

The client environment typically follows these key steps when starting a pipeline:

1. Compiling an intermediate pipeline representation via the `@pipeline` function.
2. Creating or triggering [pipeline and step build environments](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/image-builders) if running remotely.
3. Triggering a run in the [orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/orchestrators).

Please note that the `@pipeline` function in your code is **only ever called** in this environment. Therefore, any computational logic that is executed in the pipeline function needs to be relevant to this so-called _compile time_, rather than at _execution_ time, which happens later.

## ZenML Server Environment

The ZenML server environment is a FastAPI application managing pipelines and metadata. It includes the ZenML Dashboard and is accessed when you [deploy ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml). To manage dependencies, install them during [ZenML deployment](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml), but only if you have custom integrations, as most are built-in.

See also [here](./configure-the-server-environment.md) for more on [configuring the server environment](./configure-the-server-environment.md).

## Execution Environments

When running locally, there is no real concept of an `execution` environment as the client, server, and execution environment are all the same. However, when running a pipeline remotely, ZenML needs to transfer your code and environment over to the remote [orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/orchestrators). In order to achieve this, ZenML builds Docker images known as `execution environments`.

ZenML handles the Docker image configuration, creation, and pushing, starting with a [base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml) containing ZenML and Python, then adding pipeline dependencies. To manage the Docker image configuration, follow the steps in the [containerize your pipeline](https://docs.zenml.io//how-to/customize-docker-builds) guide, including specifying additional pip dependencies, using a custom parent image, and customizing the build process.

## Image Builder Environment

By default, execution environments are created locally in the [client environment](#client-environment-or-the-runner-environment) using the local Docker client. However, this requires Docker installation and permissions. ZenML offers [image builders](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/image-builders), a special [stack component](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks), allowing users to build and push Docker images in a different specialized _image builder environment_.

Note that even if you don't configure an image builder in your stack, ZenML still uses the [local image builder](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/image-builders/local) to retain consistency across all builds. In this case, the image builder environment is the same as the client environment.
