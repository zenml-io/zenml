# Using a custom step invocation ID

When calling a ZenML step as part of your pipeline, it gets assigned a unique **invocation ID** that you can use to reference this step invocation when [defining the execution order](control-execution-order-of-steps.md) of your pipeline steps or use it to [fetch information](../../../user-guide/tutorial/fetching-pipelines.md) about the invocation after the pipeline has finished running.

```python
from zenml import pipeline, step

@step
def my_step() -> None:
    ...

@pipeline
def example_pipeline():
    # When calling a step for the first time inside a pipeline,
    # the invocation ID will be equal to the step name -> `my_step`.
    my_step()
    # When calling the same step again, the suffix `_2`, `_3`, ... will
    # be appended to the step name to generate a unique invocation ID.
    # For this call, the invocation ID would be `my_step_2`.
    my_step()
    # If you want to use a custom invocation ID when calling a step, you can
    # do so by passing it like this. If you pass a custom ID, it needs to be
    # unique for all the step invocations that happen as part of this pipeline.
    my_step(id="my_custom_invocation_id")
