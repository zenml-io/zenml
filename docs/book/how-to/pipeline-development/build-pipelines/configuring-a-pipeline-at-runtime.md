# Runtime configuration of a pipeline run

It is often the case that there is a need to run a pipeline with a different configuration.
In this case, you should in most cases use the [`pipeline.with_options`](../../pipeline-development/use-configuration-files/README.md) method. You can do this:

1. Either by explicitly configuring options like `with_options(steps="trainer": {"parameters": {"param1": 1}})`
2. Or by passing a YAML file using `with_options(config_file="path_to_yaml_file")`.

You can learn more about these options [here](../../pipeline-development/use-configuration-files/README.md).

However, there is one exception: if you would like to trigger a pipeline from the client
or another pipeline, you would need to pass the `PipelineRunConfiguration` object.
Learn more about this [here](../../trigger-pipelines/use-templates-python.md#advanced-usage-run-a-template-from-another-pipeline).
