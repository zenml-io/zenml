You can get the `pip` requirements of your stack by running the `zenml stack export-requirements <STACK-NAME>` CLI command.

To install those requirements, it's best to write them to a file and then install them like this:
```bash
zenml stack export-requirements <STACK-NAME> --output-file stack_requirements.txt
pip install -r stack_requirements.txt
```
