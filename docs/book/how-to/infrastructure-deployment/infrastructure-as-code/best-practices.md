# Architecting ML Infrastructure with ZenML and Terraform

## The Challenge

You're a system architect tasked with setting up a scalable ML infrastructure that needs to:
- Support multiple ML teams with different requirements
- Work across multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Maintain security and compliance standards
- Allow teams to iterate quickly without infrastructure bottlenecks

## The ZenML Approach

ZenML introduces [stack components](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks) as abstractions over infrastructure resources. Let's explore how to architect this effectively with Terraform using the official ZenML provider.

## Part 1: Foundation - Stack Component Architecture

### The Problem
Different teams need different ML infrastructure configurations, but you want to maintain consistency and reusability.

### The Solution: Component-Based Architecture

Start by breaking down your infrastructure into reusable modules that map to ZenML stack components:

```hcl
# modules/zenml_stack_base/main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zenml = {
      source = "zenml-io/zenml"
    }
    google = {
      source = "hashicorp/google"
    }
  }
}

resource "random_id" "suffix" {
  # This will generate a string of 12 characters, encoded as base64 which makes
  # it 8 characters long
  byte_length = 6
}

# Create base infrastructure resources, including a shared object storage,
# and container registry. This module should also create resources used to
# authenticate with the cloud provider and authorize access to the resources
# (e.g. user accounts, service accounts, workload identities, roles,
# permissions etc.)
module "base_infrastructure" {
  source = "./modules/base_infra"
  
  environment = var.environment
  project_id  = var.project_id
  region      = var.region
  
  # Generate consistent random naming across resources
  resource_prefix = "zenml-${var.environment}-${random_id.suffix.hex}"
}

# Create a flexible service connector for authentication
resource "zenml_service_connector" "base_connector" {
  name        = "${var.environment}-base-connector"
  type        = "gcp"
  auth_method = "service-account"

  configuration = {
    project_id = var.project_id
    region     = var.region
    service_account_json = module.base_infrastructure.service_account_key
  }

  labels = {
    environment = var.environment
  }
}

# Create base stack components
resource "zenml_stack_component" "artifact_store" {
  name   = "${var.environment}-artifact-store"
  type   = "artifact_store"
  flavor = "gcp"

  configuration = {
    path = "gs://${module.base_infrastructure.artifact_store_bucket}/artifacts"
  }

  connector_id = zenml_service_connector.base_connector.id
}

resource "zenml_stack_component" "container_registry" {
  name   = "${var.environment}-container-registry"
  type   = "container_registry"
  flavor = "gcp"

  configuration = {
    uri = module.base_infrastructure.container_registry_uri
  }

  connector_id = zenml_service_connector.base_connector.id
}

resource "zenml_stack_component" "orchestrator" {
  name   = "${var.environment}-orchestrator"
  type   = "orchestrator"
  flavor = "vertex"

  configuration = {
    location      = var.region
    workload_service_account = "${module.base_infrastructure.service_account_email}"
  }

  connector_id = zenml_service_connector.base_connector.id
}

# Create the base stack
resource "zenml_stack" "base_stack" {
  name = "${var.environment}-base-stack"

  components = {
    artifact_store     = zenml_stack_component.artifact_store.id
    container_registry = zenml_stack_component.container_registry.id
    orchestrator       = zenml_stack_component.orchestrator.id
  }

  labels = {
    environment = var.environment
    type        = "base"
  }
}
```

Teams can extend this base stack:

```hcl
# team_configs/training_stack.tf

# Add training-specific components
resource "zenml_stack_component" "training_orchestrator" {
  name   = "${var.environment}-training-orchestrator"
  type   = "orchestrator"
  flavor = "vertex"

  configuration = {
    location      = var.region
    machine_type  = "n1-standard-8"
    gpu_enabled   = true
    synchronous   = true
  }

  connector_id = zenml_service_connector.base_connector.id
}

# Create specialized training stack
resource "zenml_stack" "training_stack" {
  name = "${var.environment}-training-stack"

  components = {
    artifact_store     = zenml_stack_component.artifact_store.id
    container_registry = zenml_stack_component.container_registry.id
    orchestrator       = zenml_stack_component.training_orchestrator.id
  }

  labels = {
    environment = var.environment
    type        = "training"
  }
}
```

## Part 2: Environment Management and Authentication

### The Problem
Different environments (dev, staging, prod) require:
- Different authentication methods and security levels
- Environment-specific resource configurations
- Isolation between environments to prevent cross-environment impacts
- Consistent management patterns while maintaining flexibility

### The Solution: Environment Configuration Pattern with Smart Authentication

Create a flexible [service connector](../auth-management/README.md) setup that adapts to your environment. For example,
in development, a service account might be the more flexible pattern, while in production we go through
workload identity. Combine environment-specific configurations with appropriate authentication methods:

```hcl
locals {
  # Define configurations per environment
  env_config = {
    dev = {
      # Resource configuration
      machine_type = "n1-standard-4"
      gpu_enabled  = false
      
      # Authentication configuration
      auth_method = "service-account"
      auth_configuration = {
        service_account_json = file("dev-sa.json")
      }
    }
    prod = {
      # Resource configuration
      machine_type = "n1-standard-8"
      gpu_enabled  = true
      
      # Authentication configuration
      auth_method = "external-account"
      auth_configuration = {
        external_account_json = file("prod-sa.json")
      }
    }
  }
}

# Create environment-specific connector
resource "zenml_service_connector" "env_connector" {
  name        = "${var.environment}-connector"
  type        = "gcp"
  auth_method = local.env_config[var.environment].auth_method

  dynamic "configuration" {
    for_each = try(local.env_config[var.environment].auth_configuration, {})
    content {
      key   = configuration.key
      value = configuration.value
    }
  }
}

# Create environment-specific orchestrator
resource "zenml_stack_component" "env_orchestrator" {
  name   = "${var.environment}-orchestrator"
  type   = "orchestrator"
  flavor = "vertex"
  
  configuration = {
    location     = var.region
    machine_type = local.env_config[var.environment].machine_type
    gpu_enabled  = local.env_config[var.environment].gpu_enabled
  }
  
  connector_id = zenml_service_connector.env_connector.id
  
  labels = {
    environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

## Part 3: Resource Sharing and Isolation

### The Problem
Different ML projects often require strict isolation of data and security to prevent unauthorized access and ensure compliance with security policies. Ensuring that each project has its own isolated resources, such as artifact stores or orchestrators, is crucial to prevent data leakage and maintain the integrity of each project's environment. This focus on data and security isolation is essential for managing multiple ML projects securely and effectively.

### The Solution: Resource Scoping Pattern

Implement resource sharing with project isolation:

```hcl
locals {
  project_paths = {
    fraud_detection = "projects/fraud_detection/${var.environment}"
    recommendation  = "projects/recommendation/${var.environment}"
  }
}

# Create shared artifact store components with project isolation
resource "zenml_stack_component" "project_artifact_stores" {
  for_each = local.project_paths
  
  name   = "${each.key}-artifact-store"
  type   = "artifact_store"
  flavor = "gcp"
  
  configuration = {
    path = "gs://${var.shared_bucket}/${each.value}"
  }
  
  connector_id = zenml_service_connector.env_connector.id
  
  labels = {
    project     = each.key
    environment = var.environment
  }
}

# The orchestrator is shared across all stacks
resource "zenml_stack_component" "project_orchestrator" {
  name   = "shared-orchestrator"
  type   = "orchestrator"
  flavor = "vertex"
  
  configuration = {
    location = var.region
    project  = var.project_id
  }
  
  connector_id = zenml_service_connector.env_connector.id
  
  labels = {
    environment = var.environment
  }
}

# Create project-specific stacks separated by artifact stores
resource "zenml_stack" "project_stacks" {
  for_each = local.project_paths
  
  name = "${each.key}-stack"
  
  components = {
    artifact_store = zenml_stack_component.project_artifact_stores[each.key].id
    orchestrator   = zenml_stack_component.project_orchestrator.id
  }
  
  labels = {
    project     = each.key
    environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

## Part 4: Advanced Stack Management Practices

1. **Stack Component Versioning**
```hcl
locals {
  stack_version = "1.2.0"
  common_labels = {
    version     = local.stack_version
    managed_by  = "terraform"
    environment = var.environment
  }
}

resource "zenml_stack" "versioned_stack" {
  name   = "stack-v${local.stack_version}"
  labels = local.common_labels
}
```

2. **Service Connector Management**
```hcl
# Create environment-specific connectors with clear purposes
resource "zenml_service_connector" "env_connector" {
  name        = "${var.environment}-${var.purpose}-connector"
  type        = var.connector_type
  
  # Use workload identity for production
  auth_method = var.environment == "prod" ? "workload-identity" : "service-account"
  
  # Use a specific resource type and resource ID
  resource_type = var.resource_type
  resource_id   = var.resource_id
  
  labels = merge(local.common_labels, {
    purpose = var.purpose
  })
}
```

3. **Component Configuration Management**
```hcl
# Define reusable configurations
locals {
  base_configs = {
    orchestrator = {
      location = var.region
      project  = var.project_id
    }
    artifact_store = {
      path_prefix = "gs://${var.bucket_name}"
    }
  }
  
  # Environment-specific overrides
  env_configs = {
    dev = {
      orchestrator = {
        machine_type = "n1-standard-4"
      }
    }
    prod = {
      orchestrator = {
        machine_type = "n1-standard-8"
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "zenml_stack_component" "configured_component" {
  name   = "${var.environment}-${var.component_type}"
  type   = var.component_type
  
  # Merge configurations
  configuration = merge(
    local.base_configs[var.component_type],
    try(local.env_configs[var.environment][var.component_type], {})
  )
}
```

4. **Stack Organization and Dependencies**
```hcl
# Group related components with clear dependency chains
module "ml_stack" {
  source = "./modules/ml_stack"
  
  depends_on = [
    module.base_infrastructure,
    module.security
  ]
  
  components = {
    # Core components
    artifact_store     = module.storage.artifact_store_id
    container_registry = module.container.registry_id
    
    # Optional components based on team needs
    orchestrator       = var.needs_orchestrator ? module.compute.orchestrator_id : null
    experiment_tracker = var.needs_tracking ? module.mlflow.tracker_id : null
  }
  
  labels = merge(local.common_labels, {
    stack_type = "ml-platform"
  })
}
```

5. **State Management**
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    prefix = "terraform/state"
  }
  
  # Separate state files for infrastructure and ZenML
  workspace_prefix = "zenml-"
}

# Use data sources to reference infrastructure state
data "terraform_remote_state" "infrastructure" {
  backend = "gcs"
  
  config = {
    bucket = var.state_bucket
    prefix = "terraform/infrastructure"
  }
}
```

These practices help maintain a clean, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure codebase while following infrastructure-as-code best practices. Remember to:

- Keep configurations DRY using locals and variables
- Use consistent naming conventions across resources
- Document all required configuration fields
- Consider component dependencies when organizing stacks
- Separate infrastructure and ZenML registration state
- Use [Terraform workspaces](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/workspaces.html) for different environments
- Ensure that the ML operations team manages the registration state to maintain control over the ZenML stack components and their configurations. This helps in keeping the infrastructure and ML operations aligned and allows for better tracking and auditing of changes.

## Conclusion

Building ML infrastructure with ZenML and Terraform enables you to create a flexible, maintainable, and secure environment for ML teams. The official ZenML provider simplifies the process while maintaining clean infrastructure patterns.
