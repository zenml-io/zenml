# Infrastructure as code

[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac) is\
the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code\
instead of through manual processes.

In this section, we will show you how to integrate ZenML with popular\
IaC tools such as [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
