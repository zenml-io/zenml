# Advanced Features

This guide covers advanced features and capabilities of ZenML pipelines and steps, allowing you to build more sophisticated machine learning workflows.

## Execution Control

### Caching

Steps are automatically cached based on their inputs. When a step runs, ZenML computes a hash of the inputs and checks if a previous run with the same inputs exists. If found, ZenML reuses the outputs instead of re-executing the step.

You can control caching behavior at the step level:

```python
@step(enable_cache=False)
def non_cached_step():
    pass
```

You can also configure caching at the pipeline level:

```python
@pipeline(enable_cache=False)
def my_pipeline():
    ...
```

Or modify it after definition:

```python
my_step.configure(enable_cache=False)
my_pipeline.configure(enable_cache=False)
```

Cache invalidation happens automatically when:
- Step inputs change
- Step code changes
- Step configuration changes (parameters, settings, etc.)

### Running Individual Steps

You can run a single step directly:

```python
model, accuracy = train_classifier(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)
```

This creates an [unlisted pipeline run](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guides/best-practices/keep-your-dashboard-server-clean#unlisted-runs) with just that step. If you want to bypass ZenML completely and run the underlying function directly:

```python
model, accuracy = train_classifier.entrypoint(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)
```

You can make this the default behavior by setting the `ZENML_RUN_SINGLE_STEPS_WITHOUT_STACK` environment variable to `True`.

### Asynchronous Pipeline Execution

By default, pipelines run synchronously, with terminal logs displaying as the pipeline builds and runs. You can change this behavior to run pipelines asynchronously (in the background):

```python
from zenml import pipeline

@pipeline(settings={"orchestrator": {"synchronous": False}})
def my_pipeline():
    ...
```

Alternatively, you can configure this in a YAML config file:

```yaml
settings:
  orchestrator.<STACK_NAME>:
    synchronous: false
```

You can also configure the orchestrator to always run asynchronously by setting `synchronous=False` in its configuration.

### Step Execution Order

By default, ZenML determines step execution order based on data dependencies. When a step requires output from another step, it automatically creates a dependency.

You can explicitly control execution order with the `after` parameter:

```python
@pipeline
def my_pipeline():
    step_a_output = step_a()
    step_b_output = step_b()
    
    # step_c will only run after both step_a and step_b complete, even if
    # it doesn't use their outputs directly
    step_c(after=[step_a_output, step_b_output])
    
    # You can also specify dependencies using the step invocation ID
    step_d(after="step_c")
```

This is particularly useful for steps with side effects (like data loading or model deployment) where the data dependency is not explicit.

## Data & Output Management

## Type annotations

Your functions will work as ZenML steps even if you don't provide any type annotations for their inputs and outputs. However, adding type annotations to your step functions gives you lots of additional benefits:

* **Type validation of your step inputs**: ZenML makes sure that your step functions receive an object of the correct type from the upstream steps in your pipeline.
* **Better serialization**: Without type annotations, ZenML uses [Cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) to serialize your step outputs. When provided with type annotations, ZenML can choose a [materializer](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts#materializers) that is best suited for the output. In case none of the builtin materializers work, you can even [write a custom materializer](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/data-artifact-management/handle-data-artifacts/handle-custom-data-types).

{% hint style="warning" %}
ZenML provides a built-in [CloudpickleMaterializer](https://sdkdocs.zenml.io/latest/core_code_docs/core-materializers.html#zenml.materializers.cloudpickle_materializer) that can handle any object by saving it with [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle). However, this is not production-ready because the resulting artifacts cannot be loaded when running with a different Python version. In such cases, you should consider building a [custom Materializer](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/data-artifact-management/handle-data-artifacts/handle-custom-data-types#custom-materializers) to save your objects in a more robust and efficient format.

Moreover, using the `CloudpickleMaterializer` could allow users to upload of any kind of object. This could be exploited to upload a malicious file, which could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
{% endhint %}

```python
from typing import Tuple
from zenml import step

@step
def square_root(number: int) -> float:
    return number ** 0.5

# To define a step with multiple outputs, use a `Tuple` type annotation
@step
def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    return a // b, a % b
```

If you want to make sure you get all the benefits of type annotating your steps, you can set the environment variable `ZENML_ENFORCE_TYPE_ANNOTATIONS` to `True`. ZenML will then raise an exception in case one of the steps you're trying to run is missing a type annotation.

### Tuple vs multiple outputs

It is impossible for ZenML to detect whether you want your step to have a single output artifact of type `Tuple` or multiple output artifacts just by looking at the type annotation.

We use the following convention to differentiate between the two: When the `return` statement is followed by a tuple literal (e.g. `return 1, 2` or `return (value_1, value_2)`) we treat it as a step with multiple outputs. All other cases are treated as a step with a single output of type `Tuple`.

```python
from zenml import step
from typing import Annotated
from typing import Tuple

# Single output artifact
@step
def my_step() -> Tuple[int, int]:
    output_value = (0, 1)
    return output_value

# Single output artifact with variable length
@step
def my_step(condition) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
    if condition:
        output_value = (0, 1)
    else:
        output_value = (0, 1, 2)

    return output_value

# Single output artifact using the `Annotated` annotation
@step
def my_step() -> Annotated[Tuple[int, ...], "my_output"]:
    return 0, 1


# Multiple output artifacts
@step
def my_step() -> Tuple[int, int]:
    return 0, 1


# Not allowed: Variable length tuple annotation when using
# multiple output artifacts
@step
def my_step() -> Tuple[int, ...]:
    return 0, 1
```

## Step output names

By default, ZenML uses the output name `output` for single output steps and `output_0, output_1, ...` for steps with multiple outputs. These output names are used to display your outputs in the dashboard and [fetch them after your pipeline is finished](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guides/tutorial/fetching-pipelines).

If you want to use custom output names for your steps, use the `Annotated` type annotation:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from typing import Tuple
from zenml import step

@step
def square_root(number: int) -> Annotated[float, "custom_output_name"]:
    return number ** 0.5

@step
def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Tuple[
    Annotated[int, "quotient"],
    Annotated[int, "remainder"]
]:
    return a // b, a % b
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not give your outputs custom names, the created artifacts will be named `{pipeline_name}::{step_name}::output` or `{pipeline_name}::{step_name}::output_{i}` in the dashboard. See the [documentation on artifact versioning and configuration](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guides/starter-guide/manage-artifacts) for more information.
{% endhint %}

## Workflow Patterns

### Pipeline Composition

You can compose pipelines from other pipelines to create modular, reusable workflows:

```python
@pipeline
def data_pipeline(mode: str):
    if mode == "train":
        data = training_data_loader_step()
    else:
        data = test_data_loader_step()
    
    processed_data = preprocessing_step(data)
    return processed_data

@pipeline
def training_pipeline():
    # Use another pipeline inside this pipeline
    training_data = data_pipeline(mode="train")
    model = train_model(data=training_data)
    test_data = data_pipeline(mode="test")
    evaluate_model(model=model, data=test_data)
```

Pipeline composition allows you to build complex workflows from simpler, well-tested components.

### Fan-out and Fan-in

The fan-out/fan-in pattern is a common pipeline architecture where a single step splits into multiple parallel operations (fan-out) and then consolidates the results back into a single step (fan-in). This pattern is particularly useful for parallel processing, distributed workloads, or when you need to process data through different transformations and then aggregate the results. For example, you might want to process different chunks of data in parallel and then aggregate the results:

```python
from zenml import step, get_step_context, pipeline
from zenml.client import Client


@step
def load_step() -> str:
    return "Hello from ZenML!"


@step
def process_step(input_data: str) -> str:
    return input_data


@step
def combine_step(step_prefix: str, output_name: str) -> None:
    run_name = get_step_context().pipeline_run.name
    run = Client().get_pipeline_run(run_name)

    # Fetch all results from parallel processing steps
    processed_results = {}
    for step_name, step_info in run.steps.items():
        if step_name.startswith(step_prefix):
            output = step_info.outputs[output_name][0]
            processed_results[step_info.name] = output.load()

    # Combine all results
    print(",".join([f"{k}: {v}" for k, v in processed_results.items()]))


@pipeline(enable_cache=False)
def fan_out_fan_in_pipeline(parallel_count: int) -> None:
    # Initial step (source)
    input_data = load_step()

    # Fan out: Process data in parallel branches
    after = []
    for i in range(parallel_count):
        artifact = process_step(input_data, id=f"process_{i}")
        after.append(artifact)

    # Fan in: Combine results from all parallel branches
    combine_step(step_prefix="process_", output_name="output", after=after)


fan_out_fan_in_pipeline(parallel_count=8)
```

The fan-out pattern allows for parallel processing and better resource utilization, while the fan-in pattern enables aggregation and consolidation of results. This is particularly useful for:

- Parallel data processing
- Distributed model training
- Ensemble methods
- Batch processing
- Data validation across multiple sources
- Hyperparameter tuning

Note that when implementing the fan-in step, you'll need to use the ZenML Client to query the results from previous parallel steps, as shown in the example above, and you can't pass in the result directly.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The fan-in, fan-out method has the following limitations:

1. Steps run sequentially rather than in parallel if the underlying orchestrator does not support parallel step runs (e.g. with the local orchestrator)
2. The number of steps need to be known ahead-of-time, and ZenML does not yet support the ability to dynamically create steps on the fly.
{% endhint %}

### Custom Step Invocation IDs

When calling a ZenML step as part of your pipeline, it gets assigned a unique **invocation ID** that you can use to reference this step invocation when defining the execution order of your pipeline steps or use it to fetch information about the invocation after the pipeline has finished running.

```python
from zenml import pipeline, step

@step
def my_step() -> None:
    ...

@pipeline
def example_pipeline():
    # When calling a step for the first time inside a pipeline,
    # the invocation ID will be equal to the step name -> `my_step`.
    my_step()
    # When calling the same step again, the suffix `_2`, `_3`, ... will
    # be appended to the step name to generate a unique invocation ID.
    # For this call, the invocation ID would be `my_step_2`.
    my_step()
    # If you want to use a custom invocation ID when calling a step, you can
    # do so by passing it like this. If you pass a custom ID, it needs to be
    # unique for all the step invocations that happen as part of this pipeline.
    my_step(id="my_custom_invocation_id")
```

### Named Pipeline Runs

In the output logs of a pipeline run you will see the name of the run:

```bash
Pipeline run training_pipeline-2023_05_24-12_41_04_576473 has finished in 3.742s.
```

This name is automatically generated based on the current date and time. To change the name for a run, pass `run_name` as a parameter to the `with_options()` method:

```python
training_pipeline = training_pipeline.with_options(
    run_name="custom_pipeline_run_name"
)
training_pipeline()
```

Pipeline run names must be unique, so if you plan to run your pipelines multiple times or run them on a schedule, make sure to either compute the run name dynamically or include one of the placeholders that ZenML will replace.

{% hint style="info" %}
The substitutions for the custom placeholders like `experiment_name` can be set in:
- `@pipeline` decorator, so they are effective for all steps in this pipeline
- `pipeline.with_options` function, so they are effective for all steps in this pipeline run

Standard substitutions always available and consistent in all steps of the pipeline are:
- `{date}`: current date, e.g. `2024_11_27`
- `{time}`: current time in UTC format, e.g. `11_07_09_326492`
{% endhint %}

```python
training_pipeline = training_pipeline.with_options(
    run_name="custom_pipeline_run_name_{experiment_name}_{date}_{time}"
)
training_pipeline()
```

## Error Handling & Reliability

### Automatic Step Retries

For steps that may encounter transient failures (like network issues or resource limitations), you can configure automatic retries:

```python
from zenml.config.retry_config import StepRetryConfig

@step(
    retry=StepRetryConfig(
        max_retries=3,  # Maximum number of retry attempts
        delay=10,       # Initial delay in seconds before first retry
        backoff=2       # Factor by which delay increases after each retry
    )
)
def unreliable_step():
    # This step might fail due to transient issues
    ...
```

It's important to note that **retries happen at the step level, not the pipeline level**. This means that ZenML will only retry individual failed steps, not the entire pipeline. The only exception to this is the Kubernetes orchestrator, which can be configured to retry at the pipeline level.

With this configuration, if the step fails, ZenML will:
1. Wait 10 seconds before the first retry
2. Wait 20 seconds (10 × 2) before the second retry
3. Wait 40 seconds (20 × 2) before the third retry
4. Fail the pipeline if all retries are exhausted

This is particularly useful for steps that interact with external services or resources.

## Monitoring & Notifications

### Pipeline and Step Hooks

Hooks allow you to execute custom code at specific points in the pipeline or step lifecycle:

```python
def success_hook(step_name, step_output):
    print(f"Step {step_name} completed successfully with output: {step_output}")

def failure_hook(exception: BaseException):
    print(f"Step failed with error: {str(exception)}")

@step(on_success=success_hook, on_failure=failure_hook)
def my_step():
    return 42
```

You can also define hooks at the pipeline level to apply to all steps:

```python
@pipeline(on_failure=failure_hook, on_success=success_hook)
def my_pipeline():
    ...
```

Step-level hooks take precedence over pipeline-level hooks. Hooks are particularly useful for:
- Sending notifications when steps fail or succeed
- Logging detailed information about runs
- Triggering external workflows based on pipeline state

### Accessing Step Context in Hooks

You can access detailed information about the current run using the step context:

```python
from zenml import step, get_step_context

def on_failure(exception: BaseException):
    context = get_step_context()
    print(f"Failed step: {context.step_run.name}")
    print(f"Parameters: {context.step_run.config.parameters}")
    print(f"Exception: {type(exception).__name__}: {str(exception)}")
    
    # Access pipeline information
    print(f"Pipeline: {context.pipeline_run.name}")

@step(on_failure=on_failure)
def my_step(some_parameter: int = 1):
    raise ValueError("My exception")
```

### Using Alerter in Hooks

You can use the [Alerter stack component](https://docs.zenml.io/component-guide/alerters) to send notifications when steps fail or succeed:

```python
from zenml import get_step_context
from zenml.client import Client

def on_failure():
    step_name = get_step_context().step_run.name
    Client().active_stack.alerter.post(f"{step_name} just failed!")
```

ZenML provides built-in alerter hooks for common scenarios:

```python
from zenml.hooks import alerter_success_hook, alerter_failure_hook

@step(on_failure=alerter_failure_hook, on_success=alerter_success_hook)
def my_step():
    ...
```


## Conclusion

These advanced features provide powerful capabilities for building sophisticated machine learning workflows in ZenML. By leveraging these features, you can create pipelines that are more robust, maintainable, and flexible.
