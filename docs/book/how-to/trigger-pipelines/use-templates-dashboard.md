## Create a template

In order to create a template over the dashboard, go a pipeline run that you 
executed on a remote stack (i.e. at least a remote orchestrator, artifact 
store, and container registry):

![Create Templates on the dashboard](../../../.gitbook/assets/run-templates-create-1.png)

Click on `+ New Template`, give it a name and click `Create`:

## Run a template using the dashboard

In order to run a template from the dashboard:

- You can either click `Run a Pipeline` on the main `Pipelines` page, or
- You can go to a specific template page and click on `Run Template`.

Either way, you will be forwarded to a page where you will see the 
`Run Details`. Here, you have the option to upload a `.yaml` [configurations file](../pipeline-development/use-configuration-files/README.md)
or change the configuration on the go by using our editor.

Once you run the template, a new run will be executed on the same stack as 
the original run was executed on.
