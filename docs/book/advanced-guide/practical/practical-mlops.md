This advanced guide contains some practical guides and motivating examples
showcasing the core concepts and features of MLOps. Here you will learn how
about some of the essential stack components that you will likely use as part of
your stack, from experiment trackers to model deployers.

For full illustrations of this functionality, please visit and use [our full ZenBytes course](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes)
which walks you through fully-functional examples of all of the concepts
contained in this practical MLOps guide.

## :teacher: Learn with ZenBytes

These articles are intended to showcase some of the core features, but we
recommend you work your way through [the full ZenBytes course](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) if you want to dive
into the details of the various components of a production MLOps workflow.
