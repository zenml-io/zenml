title: "Compose pipelines"
description: "Reuse steps between pipelines."

Sometimes it can be useful to extract some common functionality into separate functions in order to avoid code duplication. To facilitate this, ZenML allows you to compose your pipelines:

Copy

```
from zenml import pipeline

@pipeline

def data_loading_pipeline(mode: str):

    if mode == "train":

        data = training_data_loader_step()

    else:

        data = test_data_loader_step()
    

    processed_data = preprocessing_step(data)

    return processed_data

@pipeline

def training_pipeline():

    training_data = data_loading_pipeline(mode="train")

    model = training_step(data=training_data)

    test_data = data_loading_pipeline(mode="test")

    evaluation_step(model=model, data=test_data)
```

Here we are calling one pipeline from within another pipeline, so functionally the `data_loading_pipeline` is functioning as a step within the `training_pipeline`, i.e. the steps of the former are added to the latter. Only the parent pipeline will be visible in the dashboard. In order to actually trigger a pipeline from another, see [here](/how-to/trigger-pipelines/trigger-a-pipeline-from-another)
