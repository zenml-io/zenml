title: "Run an individual step"
---

If you want to run just an individual step on your stack, you can simply call the step as you would with a normal Python function. ZenML will internally create a pipeline with just your step and run it on the active stack.

The pipeline run that will happen to execute your step will be `unlisted`, which means it will not be associated with any pipeline. You can still see it in the "Runs" tab of the dashboard.

Copy

```
from zenml import step

import pandas as pd

from sklearn.base import ClassifierMixin

from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Configure the step to use a step operator. If you're not using

# a step operator, you can remove this and the step will run on

# your orchestrator instead.

@step(step_operator="")

def svc_trainer(

    X_train: pd.DataFrame,

    y_train: pd.Series,

    gamma: float = 0.001,

) -> Tuple[

    Annotated[ClassifierMixin, "trained_model"],

    Annotated[float, "training_acc"],

]:

    """Train a sklearn SVC classifier."""

    model = SVC(gamma=gamma)

    model.fit(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())

    train_acc = model.score(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())

    print(f"Train accuracy: {train_acc}")

    return model, train_acc

X_train = pd.DataFrame(...)

y_train = pd.Series(...)

# Call the step directly. This will internally create a

# pipeline with just this step, which will be executed on

# the active stack.

model, train_acc = svc_trainer(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)
```

## Run the underlying step function directly

If you instead want to run your step function without ZenML getting involved, you can use the `entrypoint(...)` method of a step:

Copy

```
X_train = pd.DataFrame(...)

y_train = pd.Series(...)

model, train_acc = svc_trainer.entrypoint(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)
```

If you want to make this the default behavior when calling a step, you can set the `ZENML_RUN_SINGLE_STEPS_WITHOUT_STACK` environment variable to `True`. Once you do that, calling `svc_trainer(...)` will simply call the underlying function and not use your ZenML stack.
