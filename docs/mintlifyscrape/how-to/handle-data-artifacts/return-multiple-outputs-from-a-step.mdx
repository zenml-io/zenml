You can use the `Annotated` type to return multiple outputs from a step and give each output a name. Naming your step outputs will help you retrieve the specific artifact later and also improves the readability of your pipeline's dashboard.

Copy

```
from typing import Annotated, Tuple

import pandas as pd

from zenml import step

@step

def clean_data(

    data: pd.DataFrame,

) -> Tuple[

    Annotated[pd.DataFrame, "x_train"],

    Annotated[pd.DataFrame, "x_test"],

    Annotated[pd.Series, "y_train"],

    Annotated[pd.Series, "y_test"],

]:

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    x = data.drop("target", axis=1)

    y = data["target"]

    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    return x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test
```

In this code, the `clean_data` step takes a pandas DataFrame as input and returns a tuple of four elements: `x_train`, `x_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`. Each element in the tuple is annotated with a specific name using the `Annotated` type.

Inside the step, we split the input data into features (`x`) and target (`y`), and then use `train_test_split` from scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets. The resulting DataFrames and Series are returned as a tuple, with each element annotated with its respective name.

By using `Annotated`, we can easily identify and retrieve specific artifacts later in the pipeline. Additionally, the names will be displayed on the pipeline's dashboard, making it more readable and understandable.
