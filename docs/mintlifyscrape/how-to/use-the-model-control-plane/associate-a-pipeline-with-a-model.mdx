title: "Associate a pipeline with a Model"
---

The most common use-case for a Model is to associate it with a pipeline.

Copy

```
from zenml import pipeline

from zenml import Model

@pipeline(

    model=Model(

        name="ClassificationModel",  # Give your models unique names

        tags=["MVP", "Tabular"]  # Use tags for future filtering

    )

)

def my_pipeline():

    ...
```

This will associate this pipeline with the model specified. In case the model already exists, this will create a new version of that model.

In case you want to attach the pipeline to an existing model version, specify this as well.

Copy

```
from zenml import pipeline

from zenml import Model

from zenml.enums import ModelStages

@pipeline(

    model=Model(

        name="ClassificationModel",  # Give your models unique names

        tags=["MVP", "Tabular"],  # Use tags for future filtering

        version=ModelStages.LATEST  # Alternatively use a stage: [STAGING, PRODUCTION]]

    )

)

def my_pipeline():

    ...
```

Feel free to also move the Model configuration into your configuration files:

Copy

```
...

model:

  name: text_classifier

  description: A breast cancer classifier

  tags: ["classifier","sgd"]

...
```
