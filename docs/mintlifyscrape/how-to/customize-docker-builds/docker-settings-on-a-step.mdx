title: "Docker settings on a step"
description: "You have the option to customize the Docker settings at a step level."

By default every step of a pipeline uses the same Docker image that is defined at the [pipeline level](/how-to/customize-docker-builds/docker-settings-on-a-pipeline). Sometimes your steps will have special requirements that make it necessary to define a different Docker image for one or many steps. This can easily be accomplished by adding the [DockerSettings](https://sdkdocs.zenml.io/latest/core%5Fcode%5Fdocs/core-config/#zenml.config.docker%5Fsettings.DockerSettings) to the step decorator directly.

Copy

```
from zenml import step

from zenml.config import DockerSettings

@step(

  settings={

    "docker": DockerSettings(

      parent_image="pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime"

    )

  }

)

def training(...):

	...
```

Alternatively, this can also be done within the configuration file.

Copy

```
steps:

  training:

    settings:

      docker:

        parent_image: pytorch/pytorch:2.2.0-cuda11.8-cudnn8-runtime

        required_integrations:

          - gcp

          - github

        requirements:

          - zenml  # Make sure to include ZenML for other parent images

          - numpy
```
