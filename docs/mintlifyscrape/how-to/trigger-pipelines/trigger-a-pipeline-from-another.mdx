This is a [ZenML Pro](https://zenml.io/pro) only feature. Please [sign up here](https://cloud.zenml.io) get access. OSS users can only trigger a pipeline by calling the pipeline function inside their runner script.

Triggering a pipeline from another **only** works if you've created at least one run template for that pipeline.

Copy

```
import pandas as pd

from zenml import pipeline, step

from zenml.client import Client

from zenml.config.pipeline_run_configuration import PipelineRunConfiguration

@step  

def trainer(data_artifact_id: str):

    df = load_artifact(data_artifact_id)

@pipeline

def training_pipeline():

    trainer()

@step  

def load_data() -> pd.Dataframe:

    ...

@step  

def trigger_pipeline(df: UnmaterializedArtifact):

    # By using UnmaterializedArtifact we can get the ID of the artifact

    run_config = PipelineRunConfiguration(steps={"trainer": {"parameters": {"data_artifact_id": df.id}}})

    Client().trigger_pipeline("training_pipeline", run_configuration=run_config)

@pipeline  

def loads_data_and_triggers_training():

    df = load_data()

    trigger_pipeline(df)  # Will trigger the other pipeline
```
