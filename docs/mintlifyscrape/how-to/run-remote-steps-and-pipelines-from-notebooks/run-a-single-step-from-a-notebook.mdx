title: "Run a single step from a notebook"
---

If you want to run just a single step remotely from a notebook, you can simply call the step as you would with a normal Python function. ZenML will internally create a pipeline with just your step and run it on the active stack.

When defining a step that should be run remotely in a notebook, make sure you're aware of all the [limitations](/how-to/run-remote-steps-and-pipelines-from-notebooks/limitations-of-defining-steps-in-notebook-cells) that apply.

Copy

```
from zenml import step

import pandas as pd

from sklearn.base import ClassifierMixin

from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Configure the step to use a step operator. If you're not using

# a step operator, you can remove this and the step will run on

# your orchestrator instead.

@step(step_operator="")

def svc_trainer(

    X_train: pd.DataFrame,

    y_train: pd.Series,

    gamma: float = 0.001,

) -> Tuple[

    Annotated[ClassifierMixin, "trained_model"],

    Annotated[float, "training_acc"],

]:

    """Train a sklearn SVC classifier."""

    model = SVC(gamma=gamma)

    model.fit(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())

    train_acc = model.score(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())

    print(f"Train accuracy: {train_acc}")

    return model, train_acc

X_train = pd.DataFrame(...)

y_train = pd.Series(...)

# Call the step directly. This will internally create a

# pipeline with just this step, which will be executed on

# the active stack.

model, train_acc = svc_trainer(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)
```
