description: "Deploying ZenML on cloud using Docker or Helm"
---

If you wish to deploy ZenML on clouds other than AWS, Azure and GCP or on any other resource like a serverless platform or an on-prem Kubernetes cluster, you have two options:

- Using a Docker container.

- Using the Helm chart.

#### Using Helm

The ZenML repository hosts a Helm chart that can be used to deploy to Kubernetes. This chart is not hosted on an online repository yet and so you can follow the steps below:

- Clone the `zenml-io/zenml` repository.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git
  ```

- Go into the directory that hosts the chart.

  ```sh
  cd src/zenml/zen_server/deploy/helm/
  ```

- Take a look at the `values.yaml` file to configure settings for your ZenML deployment. Make sure you have a MySQL database to use with the server and fill the `zenml.database` map with its values.

- Once everything is configured, you can now run the following command to create a release.
  ```sh
  helm -n <KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE> --create-namespace install zenml-server .
  ```

> <Note>
>   You will need to have an existing Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` installed
>   and configured, in addition to having `helm` itself.
