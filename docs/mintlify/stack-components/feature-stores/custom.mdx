  Before diving into the specifics of this component type, it is beneficial to familiarize yourself with our [general guide to writing custom component flavors in ZenML](/stack-components/stack-deployment/implement-a-custom-stack-component). This guide provides an essential understanding of ZenML's component flavor concepts.

Feature stores allow data teams to serve data via an offline store, and an online low-latency store where data is kept in sync between the two. It also offers a centralized registry where features (and feature schemas) are stored for use within a team or wider organization.

<Note>
**Base abstraction in progress!**

We are actively working on the base abstraction for the feature stores, which will be available soon. As a result, their extension is not possible at the moment. If you would like to use a feature store in your stack, please check the list of already available feature stores down below.
