title: "Using a custom step invocation ID"
description: "When calling a ZenML step as part of your pipeline, it gets assigned a unique **invocation ID** that you can use to reference this step invocation when [defining the execution order](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/build-pipelines/control-execution-order-of-steps) of your pipeline steps or use it to [fetch information](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/build-pipelines/fetching-pipelines) about the invocation after the pipeline has finished running."

```py
from zenml import pipeline, step

@step
def my_step() -> None:
    ...

@pipeline
def example_pipeline():
    # When calling a step for the first time inside a pipeline,
    # the invocation ID will be equal to the step name -> `my_step`.
    my_step()
    # When calling the same step again, the suffix `_2`, `_3`, ... will
    # be appended to the step name to generate a unique invocation ID.
    # For this call, the invocation ID would be `my_step_2`.
    my_step()
    # If you want to use a custom invocation ID when calling a step, you can
    # do so by passing it like this. If you pass a custom ID, it needs to be
    # unique for all the step invocations that happen as part of this pipeline.
    my_step(id="my_custom_invocation_id")
```
