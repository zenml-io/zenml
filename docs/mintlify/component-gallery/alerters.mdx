**Alerters** allow you to send messages to chat services (like Slack, Discord, Mattermost, etc.) from within your pipelines. This is useful to immediately get notified when failures happen, for general monitoring/reporting, and also for building human-in-the-loop ML.

## Alerter Flavors

Currently, the [SlackAlerter](/component-gallery/alerters/slack) is the only available alerter integration. However, it is straightforward to extend ZenML and [build an alerter for other chat services](/component-gallery/alerters/custom).

| Alerter                                                       | Flavor   | Integration | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Slack](/component-gallery/alerters/slack)                  | slack    | slack       | Interacts with a Slack channel                                     |
| [Custom Implementation](/component-gallery/alerters/custom) | _custom_ |            | Extend the alerter abstraction and provide your own implementation |

If you would like to see the available flavors of alerters in your terminal, you can use the following command:

```
zenml alerter flavor list
```

## How to use Alerters with ZenML

Each alerter integration comes with specific standard steps that you can use out-of-the-box.

However, you first need to register an alerter component in your terminal:

```
zenml alerter register  ...
```

Then you can add it to your stack using

```
zenml stack register ... -al 
```

Afterwards, you can import the alerter standard steps provided by the respective integration and directly use them in your pipelines.
