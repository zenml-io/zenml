## Fetching secret values in a step

 Additionally, a secret always has a **name** that allows you to fetch or reference them in your pipelines and stacks. In order to learn more about how to configure and create secrets, please refer to the [platform guide on secrets](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/secret-management).

You can access secrets directly from within your steps through the ZenML `Client` API. This allows you to use your secrets for querying APIs from within your step without hard-coding your access keys:

```py
from zenml import step
from zenml.client import Client

from somewhere import authenticate_to_some_api


@step
def secret_loader() -> None:
    """Load the example secret from the server."""
    # Fetch the secret from ZenML.
    secret = Client().get_secret("<SECRET_NAME>")

    # `secret.secret_values` will contain a dictionary with all key-value
    # pairs within your secret.
    authenticate_to_some_api(
        username=secret.secret_values["username"],
        password=secret.secret_values["password"],
    )
    ...
```
