Hooks are a way to perform an action after a step has completed execution. They can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as sending notifications, logging, or cleaning up resources after a step has been completed.

A hook executes right after step execution, within the same environment as the step, therefore it has access to all the dependencies that a step has. Currently, there are two sorts of hooks that can be defined: `on_failure` and `on_success` .

* `on_failure`: This hook triggers in the event of a step failing.
* `on_success`: This hook triggers in the event of a step succeeding.

Here is a short demo for hooks in ZenML:

## Defining hooks

A hook can be defined as a callback function, and must be accessible within the repository where the pipeline and steps are located.

In case of failure hooks, you can optionally add a `BaseException` argument to the hook, allowing you to access the concrete Exception that caused your step to fail:

```py
from zenml import step

def on_failure(exception: BaseException):
    print(f"Step failed: {str(exception)}")


def on_success():
    print("Step succeeded!")


@step(on_failure=on_failure)
def my_failing_step() -> int:
    """Returns an integer."""
    raise ValueError("Error")


@step(on_success=on_success)
def my_successful_step() -> int:
    """Returns an integer."""
    return 1
```

In this example, we define two hooks: `on_failure` and `on_success`, which print a message when the step fails or succeeds, respectively. We then use these hooks with two steps, `my_failing_step` and `my_successful_step`. When `my_failing_step` is executed, it raises a `ValueError`, which triggers the `on_failure` hook. Similarly, when `my_successful_step` is executed, it returns an integer successfully, which triggers the on\_success hook.

A step can also be specified as a local user-defined function path (of the form `mymodule.myfile.my_function`). This is particularly useful when defining the hooks via a [YAML Config](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/use-configuration-files).

## Defining hooks on a pipeline level

In some cases, there is a need to define a hook on all steps of a given pipeline. Rather than having to define it on all steps individually, you can also specify any hook on the pipeline level.

```py

@pipeline(on_failure=on_failure, on_success=on_success)
def my_pipeline(...):
    ...
```

<Note>
Note, that **step-level** defined hooks take **precedence** over **pipeline-level** defined hooks.

In [steps/alerts/notify\_on.py](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/release/0.66.0/examples/e2e/steps/alerts/notify%5Fon.py), you will find a step to notify the user about success and a function used to notify the user about step failure using the [Alerter](/stack-components/alerters) from the active stack.

We use `@step` for success notification to only notify the user about a fully successful pipeline run and not about every successful step.

In [pipelines/training.py](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/release/0.66.0/examples/e2e/pipelines/training.py), you can find the usage of a notification step and a function. We will attach a `notify_on_failure` function directly to the pipeline definition like this:

```py
from zenml import pipeline
@pipeline(
    ...
    on_failure=notify_on_failure,
    ...
)
```
At the very end of the training pipeline, we will execute the `notify_on_success` step, but only after all other steps have finished - we control it with `after` statement as follows:

```Bash
...
last_step_name = "promote_metric_compare_promoter"

notify_on_success(after=[last_step_name])
...
```
</Accordion>


## Accessing step information inside a hook

Similar as for regular ZenML steps, you can use the [StepContext](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/track-metrics-metadata/fetch-metadata-within-steps) to access information about the current pipeline run or step inside your hook function:


```py
from zenml import step, get_step_context

def on_failure(exception: BaseException):
    context = get_step_context()
    print(context.step_run.name)  # Output will be `my_step`
    print(context.step_run.config.parameters)  # Print parameters of the step
    print(type(exception))  # Of type value error
    print("Step failed!")


@step(on_failure=on_failure)
def my_step(some_parameter: int = 1)
    raise ValueError("My exception")
```

In [steps/alerts/notify\_on.py](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/release/0.66.0/examples/e2e/steps/alerts/notify%5Fon.py), you will find a step to notify the user about success and a function used to notify the user about step failure using the [Alerter](/stack-components/alerters) from the active stack.

We use `@step` for success notification to only notify the user about a fully successful pipeline run and not about every successful step.

Inside the helper function `build_message()`, you will find an example on how developers can work with [StepContext](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/track-metrics-metadata/fetch-metadata-within-steps) to form a proper notification:

```py
from zenml import get_step_context

def build_message(status: str) -> str:
    """Builds a message to post.

    Args:
        status: Status to be set in text.

    Returns:
        str: Prepared message.
    """
    step_context = get_step_context()
    run_url = get_run_url(step_context.pipeline_run)

    return (
        f"Pipeline `{step_context.pipeline.name}` [{str(step_context.pipeline.id)}] {status}!\n"
        f"Run `{step_context.pipeline_run.name}` [{str(step_context.pipeline_run.id)}]\n"
        f"URL: {run_url}"
    )

@step(enable_cache=False)
def notify_on_success() -> None:
    """Notifies user on pipeline success."""
    step_context = get_step_context()
    if alerter and step_context.pipeline_run.config.extra["notify_on_success"]:
        alerter.post(message=build_message(status="succeeded"))
```
</Accordion>


## Linking to the `Alerter` Stack component

A common use case is to use the [Alerter](/stack-components/alerters) component inside the failure or success hooks to notify relevant people. It is quite easy to do this:

```py

from zenml import get_step_context
from zenml.client import Client

def on_failure():
    step_name = get_step_context().step_run.name
    Client().active_stack.alerter.post(f"{step_name} just failed!")
```

ZenML provides standard failure and success hooks that use the alerter you have configured in your stack. Here's an example of how to use them in your pipelines:

```py
from zenml.hooks import alerter_success_hook, alerter_failure_hook


@step(on_failure=alerter_failure_hook, on_success=alerter_success_hook)
def my_step(...):
    ...
```
<Accordion
    title="See it in action with the E2E example"
>
```py
from zenml.client import Client
from zenml import get_step_context

alerter = Client().active_stack.alerter

def notify_on_failure() -> None:
    """Notifies user on step failure. Used in Hook."""
    step_context = get_step_context()
    if alerter and step_context.pipeline_run.config.extra["notify_on_failure"]:
        alerter.post(message=build_message(status="failed"))
```

If the Al component is not present in Stack we suppress notification, but you can also dump it to the log as Error using:

```py
from zenml.client import Client
from zenml.logger import get_logger
from zenml import get_step_context

logger = get_logger(__name__)
alerter = Client().active_stack.alerter

def notify_on_failure() -> None:
    """Notifies user on step failure. Used in Hook."""
    step_context = get_step_context()
    if step_context.pipeline_run.config.extra["notify_on_failure"]:
        if alerter:
            alerter.post(message=build_message(status="failed"))
        else:
            logger.error(message=build_message(status="failed"))
```
</Accordion>

## Using the OpenAI ChatGPT failure hook

The OpenAI ChatGPT failure hook is a hook that uses the OpenAI integration to generate a possible fix for whatever exception caused the step to fail. It is quite easy to use. (You will need [a valid OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) that has correctly set up billing for this.)

<Note>
Note that using this integration will incur charges on your OpenAI account.
</Note>
First, ensure that you have the OpenAI integration installed and have stored your API key within a ZenML secret:

```shell
zenml integration install openai
zenml secret create openai --api_key=
```

Then, you can use the hook in your pipeline:

```py
from zenml.integration.openai.hooks import openai_chatgpt_alerter_failure_hook
from zenml import step

@step(on_failure=openai_chatgpt_alerter_failure_hook)
def my_step(...):
    ...
```

If you had set up a Slack alerter as your alerter, for example, then you would see a message like this:

<Frame caption="OpenAI ChatGPT Failure Hook">
    <img src="/_assets/how-to/setting-up-a-project-repository/ai.png"/>
</Frame>

You can use the suggestions as input that can help you fix whatever is going wrong in your code. If you have GPT-4 enabled for your account, you can use the `openai_gpt4_alerter_failure_hook` hook instead (imported from the same module).
