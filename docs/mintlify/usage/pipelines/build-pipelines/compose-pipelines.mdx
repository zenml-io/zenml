Sometimes it can be useful to extract some common functionality into separate functions in order to avoid code duplication. To facilitate this, ZenML allows you to compose your pipelines:

```py
from zenml import pipeline

@pipeline
def data_loading_pipeline(mode: str):
    if mode == "train":
        data = training_data_loader_step()
    else:
        data = test_data_loader_step()

    processed_data = preprocessing_step(data)
    return processed_data


@pipeline
def training_pipeline():
    training_data = data_loading_pipeline(mode="train")
    model = training_step(data=training_data)
    test_data = data_loading_pipeline(mode="test")
    evaluation_step(model=model, data=test_data)
```

<Info>
    Here we are calling one pipeline from within another pipeline, so functionally the `data_loading_pipeline` is functioning as a step within the `training_pipeline`, i.e. the steps of the former are added to the latter. Only the parent pipeline will be visible in the dashboard. In order to actually trigger a pipeline from another, see [here](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/trigger-pipelines/trigger-a-pipeline-from-another)
