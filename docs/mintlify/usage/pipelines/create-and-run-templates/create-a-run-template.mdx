The creation of a run template from a pipeline run **only** works for runs that were executed on a remote stack (i.e. at least a remote orchestrator, artifact store, and container registry).
</Note>

## Create a template in code

```py
from zenml.client import Client

run = Client().get_pipeline_run(<RUN_NAME_OR_ID>)
Client().create_run_template(
    name=<NAME>,
    deployment_id=run.deployment_id
)
```
