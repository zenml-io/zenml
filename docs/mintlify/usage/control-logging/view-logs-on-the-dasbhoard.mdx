description: By default, ZenML uses a logging handler to capture the logs that occur during the execution of a step.

Users are free to use the default python logging module or print statements, and ZenML's logging handler will catch these logs and store them.

```py
import logging

from zenml import step

@step
def my_step() -> None:
    logging.warning("`Hello`")  # You can use the regular `logging` module.
    print("World.")  # You can utilize `print` statements as well.
```

These logs are stored within the respective artifact store of your stack. This means that you can only view these logs in the dashboard _if the deployed ZenML server has direct access to the underlying artifact store_. There are two cases in which this will be true:

* In case of a local ZenML server (via `zenml up`), both local and remote artifact stores may be accessible, depending on configuration of the client.
* In case of a deployed ZenML server, logs for runs on a [local artifact store](/versions/0.66.0/stack-components/artifact-stores/local) will not be accessible. Logs for runs using a [remote artifact store](/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/production-guide/remote-storage) **may be** accessible, if the artifact store has been configured with a [service connector](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/auth-management/service-connectors-guide). Please read [this chapter](/versions/0.66.0/user-guide/production-guide/remote-storage) of the production guide to learn how to configure a remote artifact store with a service connector.

If configured correctly, the logs are displayed in the dashboard as follows:

<Note>
    If you do not want to store the logs for your pipeline (for example due to performance reduction or storage limits), you can follow [these instructions](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/control-logging/enable-or-disable-logs-storing).
