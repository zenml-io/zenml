In most cases, deploying ZenML with the default `zenmlhub/zenml-server` Docker image should work just fine. However, there are some scenarios when you might need to deploy ZenML with a custom Docker image:

* You have implemented a custom artifact store for which you want to enable [artifact visualizations](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/release/0.66.0/docs/book/versions/0.66.0/how-to/handle-data-artifacts/visualize-artifacts.md) or [step logs](/versions/0.66.0/how-to/setting-up-a-project-repository/best-practices#logging) in your dashboard.
* You have forked the ZenML repository and want to deploy a ZenML server based on your own fork because you made changes to the server / database logic.

<Note>
  Deploying ZenML with custom Docker images is only possible for [Docker](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploy-with-docker) or [Helm](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploy-with-helm) deployments.
</Note>

### Build and Push Custom ZenML Server Docker Image

Here is how you can build a custom ZenML server Docker image:

1. Set up a container registry of your choice. E.g., as an indivial developer you could create a free [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account and then set up a free Docker Hub repository.
2. Clone ZenML (or your ZenML fork) and checkout the branch that you want to deploy, e.g., if you want to deploy ZenML version 0.41.0, run

```Bash
git checkout release/0.41.0
```
3.  the [ZenML base.Dockerfile](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/docker/base.Dockerfile), e.g.:

```Bash
cp docker/base.Dockerfile docker/custom.Dockerfile
```
4. Modify the copied Dockerfile:
   * Add additional dependencies:

```Bash
RUN pip install
```
   * (Forks only) install local files instead of official ZenML:

```Bash
RUN pip install -e .[server,secrets-aws,secrets-gcp,secrets-azure,secrets-hashicorp,s3fs,gcsfs,adlfs,connectors-aws,connectors-gcp,connectors-azure]
```
5. Build and push an image based on your Dockerfile:

```Bash
docker build -f docker/custom.Dockerfile . -t /: --platform linux/amd64
docker push /:
```

<Info>
  If you want to verify your custom image locally, you can follow the [Deploy a custom ZenML image via Docker](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploy-with-custom-image#deploy-a-custom-zenml-image-via-docker) section below to deploy the ZenML server locally first.

### Deploy ZenML with your custom image

Next, adjust your preferred deployment strategy to use the custom Docker image you just built.

#### Deploy a custom ZenML image via CLI

You can deploy your custom image via the `zenml deploy` CLI command by setting the `--config` argument to a custom configuration file that has both `zenmlserver_image_repo` and `zenmlserver_image_tag` set:

1. Define a custom `config.yaml` based on the [base deployment configuration file](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploy-with-zenml-cli#base-configuration-file) and set `zenmlserver_image_repo` and `zenmlserver_image_tag` according to the custom image you built:

```Bash
zenmlserver_image_repo: /
zenmlserver_image_tag:
```
2. Run `zenml deploy` with the custom config file:

```Bash
zenml deploy --config=/PATH/TO/FILE
```

See the general [ZenML CLI Deployment Guide](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploy-with-zenml-cli) for more information on how to use the `zenml deploy` CLI command and what other options can be configured.

#### Deploy a custom ZenML image via Docker

To deploy your custom image via Docker, first familiarize yourself with the general [ZenML Docker Deployment Guide](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploy-with-docker).

To use your own image, follow the general guide step by step but replace all mentions of `zenmldocker/zenml-server` with your custom image reference `<YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG>`. E.g.:

* To run the ZenML server with Docker based on your custom image, do

```shell
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name zenml /:
```

* To use `docker-compose`, adjust your `docker-compose.yml`:

```Bash
services:
  zenml:
    image: <YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG>
```

#### Deploy a custom ZenML image via Helm

To deploy your custom image via Helm, first familiarize yourself with the general [ZenML Helm Deployment Guide](/versions/0.66.0/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploy-with-helm).

To use your own image, the only thing you need to do differently is to modify the `image` section of your `values.yaml` file:

```Bash
zenml:
  image:
    repository: <YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<IMAGE_NAME>
    tag: <IMAGE_TAG>
```
