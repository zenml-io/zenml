We would love to develop ZenML together with our community! The best way to get started is to select any issue from the [good-first-issue label](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/labels/good%20first%20issue) . If you would like to contribute, please review our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for all relevant details.

## 🆘 Where to get help

The first point of call should be [our Slack group](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/). Ask your questions about bugs or specific use cases and someone from the core team will respond.
