class StepEntrypointConfiguration(BaseEntrypointConfiguration):
    """Base class for entrypoint configurations that run a single step.

    If an orchestrator needs to run steps in a separate process or environment
    (e.g. a docker container), this class can either be used directly or
    subclassed if custom behavior is necessary.

    How to subclass:
    ----------------
    Passing additional arguments to the entrypoint:
        If you need to pass additional arguments to the entrypoint, there are
        two methods that you need to implement:
            * `get_entrypoint_options()`: This method should return all
                the options that are required in the entrypoint. Make sure to
                include the result from the superclass method so the options
                are complete.

            * `get_entrypoint_arguments(...)`: This method should return
                a list of arguments that should be passed to the entrypoint.
                Make sure to include the result from the superclass method so
                the arguments are complete.

        You'll be able to access the argument values from `self.entrypoint_args`
        inside your `StepEntrypointConfiguration` subclass.

    How to use:
    -----------
    After you created your `StepEntrypointConfiguration` subclass, you only
    have to run the entrypoint somewhere. To do this, you should execute the
    command returned by the `get_entrypoint_command()` method with the
    arguments returned by the `get_entrypoint_arguments(...)` method.

    Example:
    ```python
    class MyStepEntrypointConfiguration(StepEntrypointConfiguration):
        ...

    class MyOrchestrator(BaseOrchestrator):
        def prepare_or_run_pipeline(
            self,
            deployment: "PipelineDeployment",
            stack: "Stack",
        ) -> Any:
            ...

            cmd = MyStepEntrypointConfiguration.get_entrypoint_command()
            for step_name, step in pipeline.steps.items():
                ...

                args = MyStepEntrypointConfiguration.get_entrypoint_arguments(
                    step_name=step_name
                )
                # Run the command and pass it the arguments. Our example
                # orchestrator here executes the entrypoint in a separate
                # process, but in a real-world scenario you would probably run
                # it inside a docker container or a different environment.
                import subprocess
                subprocess.check_call(cmd + args)
    ```
