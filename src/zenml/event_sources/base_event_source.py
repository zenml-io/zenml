    """Base event source handler implementation.

    This class provides a base implementation for event source handlers.

    The base event source handler acts as an intermediary between the REST API
    endpoints and the ZenML store for all operations related to event sources.
    It implements all operations related creating, updating, deleting, and
    fetching event sources from the database. It also provides a set of methods
    that can be overridden by concrete event source handlers that need to
    react to or participate in the lifecycle of an event source:

    * `_validate_event_source_request`: validate and/or modify an event source
    before it is created (before it is persisted in the database)
    * `_process_event_source_request`: react to a new event source being created
    (after it is persisted in the database)
    * `_validate_event_source_update`: validate and/or modify an event source
    update before it is applied (before the update is saved in the database)
    * `_process_event_source_update`: react to an event source being updated
    (after the update is saved in the database)
    * `_process_event_source_delete`: react to an event source being deleted
    (before it is deleted from the database)
    * `_process_event_source_response`: modify an event source before it is
    returned to the user

    In addition to optionally overriding these methods, every event source
    handler must define and provide configuration classes for the event source
    and the event filter. These are used to validate and instantiate the
    configuration from the user requests.

    Finally, since event source handlers are also sources of events, the base
    class provides methods that implementations can use to dispatch events to
    the central event hub where they can be processed and eventually trigger
    actions.
