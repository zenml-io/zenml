    """A service represented by a local daemon process.

    This class extends the base service class with functionality concerning
    the life-cycle management and tracking of external services implemented as
    local daemon processes.

    To define a local daemon service, subclass this class and implement the
    `run` method. Upon `start`, the service will spawn a daemon process that
    ends up calling the `run` method.

    For example,

    ```python

    from zenml.services import ServiceType, LocalDaemonService, LocalDaemonServiceConfig
    import time

    class SleepingDaemonConfig(LocalDaemonServiceConfig):

        wake_up_after: int

    daemon = SleepingDaemon(config=SleepingDaemonConfig(wake_up_after=10))
    daemon.start()
    ```

    NOTE: the `SleepingDaemon` class and its parent module have to be
    discoverable as part of a ZenML `Integration`, otherwise the daemon will
    fail with the following error:

    ```
    TypeError: Cannot load service with unregistered service type:
    name='sleeper' type='daemon' flavor='sleeping' description='Sleeping daemon'
