    1. It contains all the stack related configuration attributes required to

    hostnames, URLs, references to credentials, other client related
    configuration parameters).

    deployment is stored as a database entity through the ZenML Client. This

        the information in the deployment response, particularly the
        pipeline snapshot. When determining how to name the external

        deployed immediately. The deployer can return a
        DeploymentOperationalState with a status of
