    description: >-
      The pipeline resource is the mostly construct that defines a specific techincal goal 
      (like "price prediction training pipeline"). And it groups together all users'  
      attempts towards this goal in the form of pipeline runs.
  - name: trigger
    description: >-
      A pipeline trigger is the combination of the actual trigger (`schedule`, `event`, `once-off`) 
      and the configuration in which to run, namely the pipeline configuration (like the config.yaml) and
      the stack to be run on. 
  - name: run
    description: >-
      A pipeline run contains all the information pertaining to a specific pipeline
      execution. This includes user who ran it, trigger that was used, stack it was
      run on, configuration that was used. Additionally, the run also affords 
      access to the used steps and optionally access to their outputs and artifacts.
      The run is also where information can be found regarding generated reports 
      from `data validators`, dashboards from `experiment trackers` and served models
      from `model deployers`.
  - name: step
    description: >-
      The step that was used in a given pipeline run.
  - name: stack
    description: >-
      A project can contain many different stacks (for example `dev-stack`,
      `qa-stack` and `prod-stack`). The stacks themselfes are made up from
      stack components.
  - name: component
    description: >-
      Stack components are the building blocks of the stack. There are two levels
      of abstraction captured by this resource. The `type` refers to the 
      task that the component performs (e.g `data validation`, `model deployment`). 
      The flavor refers to the actual tool that is used for this (e.g. `evidently`,
      `seldon`)
  - name: project
    description: >-
      The project is the encapsulating entity that contains stacks, compontents
      and pipelines. Users can gain access through their roles. Each project contains 
      a default stack which is used by default by all the pipeline triggers within
      unless specified otherwise.
  - name: repository
    description: >-
      Code Repositories can be defined at Project level and used to define the pipeline
      entrypoint. Additionally, Triggers can be configured to use the code of the repository to 
      run pipelines fromthe centralized ZenServer and even trigger on commits or other repo events.
  - name: user
    description: >- 
      The user is the user.
  - name: role
    description: >-
      A role dictates which resources a user is permitted to read, write or delete.
  - name: metadata-config
    description: >-
      Returns the configuration that allows the orchestrator to directly connect to the 
      metadata store. This is not used by the UI.
