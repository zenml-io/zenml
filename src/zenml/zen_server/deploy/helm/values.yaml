  # ZenML server deployment type. This field is used for telemetry purposes.

  # Unique server UUID. Used to uniquely identify the server in the

  # The ZenML authentication scheme. Use one of:
  # 
  # NO_AUTH - No authentication
  # HTTP_BASIC - HTTP Basic authentication
  # OAUTH2_PASSWORD_BEARER - OAuth2 password bearer with JWT tokens
  authType: OAUTH2_PASSWORD_BEARER

  # The ZenML server periodically syncs metadata information from the MLMD
  # database into the SQL ZenML store database. This is the frequency of the
  # sync in seconds. This determines how much time it takes for the status of a
  # pipeline run to be available in the CLI and UI after it has been recorded in
  # the MLMD database. If you're planning on having a huge number of pipeline
  # runs, you may want to increase this value to reduce the load on the ZenML
  # server.
  metadataSyncPeriod: 30
  
  # The secret key used to sign JWT tokens. Only relevant if the
  # OAUTH2_PASSWORD_BEARER authentication scheme is used. This should be set to
  # a random string with a recommended length of at least 32 characters, e.g.:
  #
  #   ```python
  #   from secrets import token_hex
  #   token_hex(32)
  #   ```
  #   
  # or:
  #
  #   ```shell
  #   openssl rand -hex 32
  #   ```

  # If not explicitly set, a random key will be generated when the helm
  # chart is installed and reused for all subsequent upgrades.

# The gRPC metadata service is an optional component, disabled by default, that

# related information). If enabled, the gRPC service will act as a proxy to the
# MLMD database. The gRPC service is not required for the ZenML server to work
# and can be safely disabled, but one advantage it brings is that it may speed
# up the pipeline execution considerably, especially when the orchestrator is
# running locally where the client is located and otherwise needs to access the
# MLMD database over the internet.
