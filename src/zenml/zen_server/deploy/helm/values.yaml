    # https://docs.zenml.io/deploying-zenml/zenml-self-hosted/deploy-with-helm#database-backup-and-recovery
    #
    # Several backup strategies are supported:
    #
    # disabled - no backup is performed
    # in-memory - the database schema and data are stored in memory. This is
    #             the fastest backup strategy, but the backup is not persisted
    #             across pod restarts, so no manual intervention is possible
    #             in case the automatic DB recovery fails after a failed DB
    #             migration. Adequate memory resources should be allocated to
    #             the ZenML server pod when using this backup strategy with
    #             large databases.
    #             This is the default backup strategy.
    # dump-file - the database schema and data are dumped to a local file.
    #             Users may optionally configure a persistent volume where
    #             the dump file will be stored by setting the
    #             `backupPVStorageSize` and optionally the
    #             `backupPVStorageClass` options. If a
    #             persistent volume is not configured, the dump file will be
    #             stored in an emptyDir volume, which is not persisted.
    #             NOTE: you should set the podSecurityContext.fsGroup option
    #             if you are using a persistent volume to store the dump file.
    # database - the database is copied to a backup database in the same
    #            database server. This requires the `backupDatabase`
    #            option to be set to the name of the backup database.
    #            This backup strategy is only supported for MySQL
    #            compatible databases and the user specified in the
    #            database URL must have permissions to manage (create, drop, and
