# order of the exceptions is important in both cases:
#
# 1. In `http_exception_from_error`, when an exception is raised in the server,
# the exception is converted to a error response with the appropriate status
# code and with the exception class name and arguments as the response body. The
# list of entries is traversed and the first entry that is the same as the
# raised exception is used. If no entry is found, the most specific exception
# that is a subclass of the raised exception is used. You should therefore
# order the exceptions from the most specific to the most generic.
#
# 2. In `exception_from_response`, when an HTTP error response is received by
# the client, the error response is converted back to an exception based on the
# status code and the exception class name and arguments extracted from the
# response body. If the exception name in the body is not found in the list of
# exceptions associated with the status code, the last (the more generic)
# exception in the list corresponding to the status code will be used. The list
# of exceptions associated with a status code should have a default exception
# as the last entry, to be used as a fallback.
#
# An exception may be associated with multiple status codes if the same
# exception can be reconstructed from two or more HTTP error responses with
# different status codes (e.g. `ValueError` and the 400 and 422 status codes).
