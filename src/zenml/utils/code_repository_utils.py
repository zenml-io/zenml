    """Manually defines a local repository for a path.

    To explain what this function does we need to take a dive into source
    resolving and what happens inside the Docker image entrypoint:
    * When trying to resolve an object to a source, we first determine whether
    the file is a user file or not.
    * If the file is a user file, we check if that user file is inside a clean
    code repository using the
    `code_repository_utils.find_active_code_repository(...)` function. If that
    is the case, the object will be resolved to a `CodeRepositorySource` which
    includes additional information about the current commit and the ID of the
    code repository.
    * The `code_repository_utils.find_active_code_repository(...)` uses the
    code repository implementation classes to check whether the code repository
    "exists" at that local path. For git repositories, this check might look as
    follows: The code repository first checks if there is a git repository at
    that path or in any parent directory. If there is, the remote URLs of this
    git repository will be checked to see if one matches the URL defined for
    the code repository.
    * When running a step inside a Docker image, ZenML potentially downloads
    files from a code repository. This usually does not download the entire
    repository (and in the case of git might not download a .git directory which
    defines a local git repository) but only specific files. If we now try to
    resolve any object while running in this container, it will not get resolved
    to a `CodeRepositorySource` as
    `code_repository_utils.find_active_code_repository(...)` won't find an
    active repository. As we downloaded these files, we however know that they
    belong to a certain code repository at a specific commit, and that's what we
    can define using this function.

    Args:
        root: The repository root.
        commit: The commit of the repository.
        repo: The code repository associated with the local repository.
