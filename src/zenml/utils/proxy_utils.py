def make_proxy_class(interface: Type[ABC], attribute: str) -> Callable[[C], C]:
    """Proxy class decorator.

    Use this decorator to transform the decorated class into a proxy that
    forwards all calls defined in the `interface` interface to the `attribute`
    class attribute that implements the same interface.

    This class is useful in cases where you need to have a base class that acts
    as a proxy or facade for one or more other classes. Both the decorated class
    and the class attribute must inherit from the same ABC interface for this to
    work. Only regular methods are supported, not class methods or attributes.

    Example: Let's say you have an interface called `BodyBuilder`, a base class
    called `FatBob` and another class called `BigJim`. `BigJim` implements the
    `BodyBuilder` interface, but `FatBob` does not. And let's say you want
    `FatBob` to look as if it implements the `BodyBuilder` interface, but in
    fact it just forwards all calls to `BigJim`. You could do this:

    ```python
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class BodyBuilder(ABC):

        @abstractmethod
        def build_body(self):
            pass

    class BigJim(BodyBuilder):

        def build_body(self):
            print("Looks fit!")

    class FatBob(BodyBuilder)

        def __init__(self):
            self.big_jim = BigJim()

        def build_body(self):
            self.big_jim.build_body()

    fat_bob = FatBob()
    fat_bob.build_body()
    ```

    But this leads to a lot of boilerplate code with bigger interfaces and
    makes everything harder to maintain. This is where the proxy class
    decorator comes in handy. Here's how to use it:

    ```python
    from zenml.utils.proxy_utils import make_proxy_class
    from typing import Optional

    @make_proxy_class(BodyBuilder, "big_jim")
    class FatBob(BodyBuilder)
        big_jim: Optional[BodyBuilder] = None

        def __init__(self):
            self.big_jim = BigJim()

    fat_bob = FatBob()
    fat_bob.build_body()
    ```

    This is the same as implementing FatBob to call BigJim explicitly, but it
    has the advantage that you don't need to write a lot of boilerplate code
    of modify the FatBob class every time you change something in the
    BodyBuilder interface.

    This proxy decorator also allows to extend classes dynamically at runtime:
    if the `attribute` class attribute is set to None, the proxy class
    will assume that the interface is not implemented by the class and will
    raise a NotImplementedError:

    ```python
    @make_proxy_class(BodyBuilder, "big_jim")
    class FatBob(BodyBuilder)
        big_jim: Optional[BodyBuilder] = None

        def __init__(self):
            self.big_jim = None

    fat_bob = FatBob()

    # Raises NotImplementedError, class not extended yet:
    fat_bob.build_body()

    fat_bob.big_jim = BigJim()
    # Now it works:
    fat_bob.build_body()
    ```

    Args:
        interface: The interface to implement.
        attribute: The attribute of the base class to forward calls to.

    Returns:
        The proxy class.
