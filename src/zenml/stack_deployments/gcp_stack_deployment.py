You will be redirected to a GCP Cloud Shell console in your browser where you'll
be asked to log into your GCP project and then create a Deployment Manager
deployment to provision the necessary cloud resources for ZenML.

**NOTE**: The Deployment Manager deployment will create the following new
resources in your GCP project. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions
and are aware of any potential costs:

- A GCS bucket registered as a [ZenML artifact store](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/artifact-stores/gcp).
- A Google Artifact Registry registered as a [ZenML container registry](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/container-registries/gcp).
- Vertex AI registered as a [ZenML orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/vertex)
and as a [ZenML step operator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/step-operators/vertex).
- GCP Cloud Build registered as a [ZenML image builder](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/image-builders/gcp).
- A GCP Service Account with the minimum necessary permissions to access the
above resources.
- A GCP Service Account access key used to give access to ZenML to connect to
the above resources through a [ZenML service connector](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/auth-management/gcp-service-connector).

The Deployment Manager deployment will automatically create a GCP Service
Account secret key and will share it with ZenML to give it permission to access
the resources created by the stack. You can revoke these permissions at any time
by deleting the Deployment Manager deployment in the GCP Cloud Console.

**Estimated costs**

A small training job would cost around: $0.60

These are rough estimates and actual costs may vary based on your usage and specific GCP pricing. 
Some services may be eligible for the GCP Free Tier. Use [the GCP Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator)
for a detailed estimate based on your usage.

⚠️  **The Cloud Shell session will warn you that the ZenML GitHub repository is
untrusted. We recommend that you review [the contents of the repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/infra/gcp)
and then check the `Trust repo` checkbox to proceed with the deployment,
otherwise the Cloud Shell session will not be authenticated to access your
GCP projects. You will also get a chance to review the scripts that will be
executed in the Cloud Shell session before proceeding.**

💡 **After the Deployment Manager deployment is complete, you can close the Cloud
Shell session and return to the CLI to view details about the associated ZenML
stack automatically registered with ZenML.**
