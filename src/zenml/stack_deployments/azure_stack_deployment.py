You will be redirected to an Azure Cloud Shell console in your browser where
you'll be asked to log into your Azure project and then use
[the Azure ZenML Stack Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/zenml-io/zenml-stack/azure)
to provision the necessary cloud resources for ZenML.

**NOTE**: The Azure ZenML Stack Terraform module will create the following new
resources in your Azure subscription. Please ensure you have the necessary
permissions and are aware of any potential costs:

- An Azure Resource Group to contain all the resources required for the ZenML stack
- An Azure Storage Account and Blob Storage Container registered as a [ZenML artifact store](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/artifact-stores/azure).
- An Azure Container Registry registered as a [ZenML container registry](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/container-registries/azure).
- An AzureML Workspace registered as both a [ZenML orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/azureml) and a
[ZenML step operator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/step-operators/azureml) and used to run pipelines.
A Key Vault and Application Insights instance will also be created in the same Resource Group and used to construct the AzureML Workspace.
- An Azure Service Principal with the minimum necessary permissions to access
the above resources.
- An Azure Service Principal client secret used to give access to ZenML to
connect to the above resources through a [ZenML service connector](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/auth-management/azure-service-connector).

The Azure ZenML Stack Terraform module will automatically create an Azure
Service Principal client secret and will share it with ZenML to give it
permission to access the resources created by the stack. You can revoke these
permissions at any time by deleting the Service Principal in your Azure
subscription.

**Estimated costs**

A small training job would cost around: $0.60

These are rough estimates and actual costs may vary based on your usage and specific Azure pricing. 
Some services may be eligible for the Azure Free Tier. Use [the Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator)
for a detailed estimate based on your usage.


ðŸ’¡ **After the Terraform deployment is complete, you can close the Cloud
Shell session and return to the CLI to view details about the associated ZenML
stack automatically registered with ZenML.**
