class ServiceConnector(BaseModel, metaclass=ServiceConnectorMeta):
    """Base service connector class.

    Service connectors are standalone components that can be used to link ZenML
    to external resources. They are responsible for validating and storing
    authentication configuration and sensitive credentials and for providing
    authentication services to other ZenML components. Service connectors are
    built on top of the (otherwise opaque) ZenML secrets and secrets store
    mechanisms and add secret auto-configuration, secret discovery and secret
    schema validation capabilities.

    The implementation independent service connector abstraction is made
    possible through the use of generic "resource types" and "resource IDs".
    These constitute the "contract" between connectors and the consumers of the
    authentication services that they provide. In a nutshell, a connector
    instance advertises what resource(s) it can be used to gain access to,
    whereas a consumer may run a query to search for compatible connectors by
    specifying the resource(s) that they need to access and then use a
    matching connector instance to connect to said resource(s).

    The resource types and authentication methods supported by a connector are
    declared in the connector type specification. The role of this specification
    is two-fold:

    - it declares a schema for the configuration that needs to be provided to
    configure the connector. This can be used to validate the configuration
    without having to instantiate the connector itself (e.g. in the CLI and
    dashboard), which also makes it possible to configure connectors and
    store their configuration without having to instantiate them.
    - it provides a way for ZenML to keep a registry of available connector
    implementations and configured connector instances. Users who want to
    connect ZenML to external resources via connectors can use this registry
    to discover what types of connectors are available and what types of
    resources they can be configured to access. Consumers can also use the
    registry to find connector instances that are compatible with the
    types of resources that they need to access.
