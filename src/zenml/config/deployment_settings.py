class EndpointSpec(BaseModel):
    """Endpoint specification.

    Use this class to configure a custom endpoint that must be registered on the
    deployment application in a framework-agnostic way.

    The handler field can be set to one of the following:

    1. The function or method that represents the actual endpoint
    implementation. This will be registered as is. The function itself may be
    framework-specific - i.e. it may use framework-specific arguments, return
    values or implementation details, e.g.:

    ```python
    async def my_handler(request: Request, my_param: InputModel) -> OutputModel:
        ...
    ```

    2. An endpoint builder class - this is a callable class (i.e. a class that
    implements the __call__ method, which is the actual endpoint implementation)
    that is used to build the endpoint. When this is used, the class constructor
    must accept an argument `app_runner` of type `BaseDeploymentAppRunner`
    which will be passed by the adapter at application build time.

    The adapter will also pass the `init_kwargs` to the class constructor if
    configured. The following is an example of an endpoint builder class

    ```python
    from zenml.deployers.server import BaseDeploymentAppRunner

    class MyHandler:
        def __init__(
            self,

            self.app_runner = app_runner
            self.kwargs = kwargs
            ...

        async def __call__(self, request: Request, my_param: InputModel) -> OutputModel:
            ...
    ```

    3. An endpoint builder function - this is a function that is used to build
    and return the endpoint. When this is used, the adapter will call the
    the provided function first and is expected to return the actual endpoint
    function. The builder function must accept an argument `app_runner` of type
    `BaseDeploymentAppRunner` which will be passed by the adapter at
    application build time.

    The adapter will also pass the `init_kwargs` to the builder function if
    configured. The following is an example of an endpoint builder function:

    ```python
    from zenml.deployers.server import BaseDeploymentAppRunner

    def my_builder(
        app_runner: "BaseDeploymentAppRunner",
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> Callable:
        ...

        async def endpoint(request: Request, my_param: InputModel) -> OutputModel:
            ...

        return endpoint
    ```

    4. Alternatively, the middleware can be set to any framework-specific
    source-loadable object that can be used directly, by setting `native` to
    `True`. In this case, the framework-specific endpoint adapter will decide
    what to do with the object and how to use the init_kwargs.

        method: HTTP method.
        handler: Handler callable or source. If this is an endpoint builder
            instead of the actual endpoint implementation, the adapter will call
            the provided callable first and is expected to return the actual
            endpoint callable.
        native: Whether the endpoint is a framework-specific source-loadable
            object that can be used directly.
        auth_required: Whether authentication is required. This is an
            indication for the adapter to apply any configured auth dependencies
            or middlewares to the endpoint.
        init_kwargs: Arguments to be passed to the endpoint builder function or
            class constructor, if provided.
        extra_kwargs: Arbitrary framework-specific arguments to be used when

    The following customizations can be used to configure aspects that are
    framework-agnostic (i.e. not specific to a particular ASGI framework like
    FastAPI, Django, Flask, etc.):

    * the ASGI application details: `app_title`, `app_description`,
    `app_version` and `app_kwargs`
    * the URL paths for the various built-in endpoints: `root_url_path`,
    `docs_url_path`, `redoc_url_path`, `invoke_url_path`, `health_url_path`,
    `info_url_path` and `metrics_url_path`
    * the location of dashboard static files can be provided to replace the
    default UI that is included with the deployment ASGI application:
    `dashboard_files_path`
    * the CORS configuration: `cors`
    * the secure headers configuration: `secure_headers`
    * the thread pool size: `thread_pool_size`
    * custom application startup and shutdown hooks: `startup_hook_source`,
    `shutdown_hook_source`, `startup_hook_kwargs` and `shutdown_hook_kwargs`
    * uvicorn server configuration: `uvicorn_host`, `uvicorn_port`,
    `uvicorn_workers` and `uvicorn_kwargs`

    In addition to the above, the following advanced features can be used to
    customize the implementation-specific details of the deployment application:

    * custom endpoints (e.g. custom metrics, custom health, etc.): `custom_endpoints`
    * custom middlewares (e.g. authentication, logging, etc.): `custom_middlewares`
    * application building extensions - these are pluggable components that can
    be used to add advanced framework-specific features like custom authentication,
    logging, metrics, etc.: `app_extensions`

    Ultimately, if neither of the above are sufficient, the user can provide a
    custom implementations for the two core components that are used to build
    and run the deployment application itself:

    * the deployment app runner - this is the component that is responsible for
    building and running the ASGI application. It is represented by the
    `zenml.deployers.server.BaseDeploymentAppRunner` class.
    See: `deployment_app_runner_flavor` and `deployment_app_runner_kwargs`
    * the deployment service - this is the component that is responsible for
    handling the business logic of the pipeline deployment. It is represented by
    the `zenml.deployers.server.BaseDeploymentService` class. See:
    `deployment_service_class` and `deployment_service_kwargs`

    Both of these base classes or their existing implementations can be extended
    and provided as sources in the deployment settings to be loaded at runtime.

    Attributes:
        app_title: Title of the deployment application.
        app_description: Description of the deployment application.
        app_version: Version of the deployment application.
        app_kwargs: Arbitrary framework-specific keyword arguments to be passed
            to the deployment ASGI application constructor.

        include_default_endpoints: Whether to include the default endpoints in
            the ASGI application.
        include_default_middleware: Whether to include the default middleware
            in the ASGI application.

        root_url_path: Root URL path.
        docs_url_path: URL path for the OpenAPI documentation endpoint.
        redoc_url_path: URL path for the Redoc documentation endpoint.

        metrics_url_path: URL path for the metrics endpoint.
        dashboard_files_path: Path where the dashboard static files are located.
            This can be used to replace the default UI that is included with the
            deployment ASGI application. The referenced directory must contain
            at a minimum an `index.html` file and a `assets` directory. The path
            can be absolute or relative to the root of the repository
            initialized with `zenml init` or relative to the current working
            directory.

        cors: Configuration for CORS.
        secure_headers: Configuration for secure headers.
        thread_pool_size: Size of the thread pool for the ASGI application.

        app_extensions: App extensions used to build the ASGI application. See
            the `AppExtensionSpec` class for more details.

        uvicorn_host: Host of the uvicorn server.
        uvicorn_port: Port of the uvicorn server.
        uvicorn_workers: Number of workers for the uvicorn server.
        log_level: Log level for the deployment application.
        uvicorn_kwargs: Keyword arguments for the uvicorn server.

        deployment_app_runner_flavor: Flavor of the deployment app runner. Must
            point to a class that extends the
            `zenml.deployers.server.BaseDeploymentAppRunnerFlavor` class.
        deployment_app_runner_kwargs: Keyword arguments for the deployment app
