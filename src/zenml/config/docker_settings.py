class DockerSettings(BaseSettings):
    """Settings for building Docker images to run ZenML pipelines.

    Build process:
    --------------
    * No `dockerfile` specified: If any of the options regarding
    requirements, environment variables or copying files require us to build an
    image, ZenML will build this image. Otherwise, the `parent_image` will be
    used to run the pipeline.
    * `dockerfile` specified: ZenML will first build an image based on the
    specified Dockerfile. If any of the options regarding
    requirements, environment variables or copying files require an additional
    image built on top of that, ZenML will build a second image. If not, the
    image build from the specified Dockerfile will be used to run the pipeline.

    Requirements installation order:
    --------------------------------
    Depending on the configuration of this object, requirements will be
    installed in the following order (each step optional):
    - The packages installed in your local python environment
    - The packages required by the stack unless this is disabled by setting
      `install_stack_requirements=False`.
    - The packages specified via the `required_integrations`
    - The packages specified via the `requirements` attribute

    Attributes:
        parent_image: Full name of the Docker image that should be
            used as the parent for the image that will be built. Defaults to
            a ZenML image built for the active Python and ZenML version.

            Additional notes:
            * If you specify a custom image here, you need to make sure it has
            ZenML installed.
            * If this is a non-local image, the environment which is running
            the pipeline and building the Docker image needs to be able to pull
            this image.
            * If a custom `dockerfile` is specified for this settings
            object, this parent image will be ignored.
        dockerfile: Path to a custom Dockerfile that should be built. Depending
            on the other values you specify in this object, the resulting
            image will be used directly to run your pipeline or ZenML will use
            it as a parent image to build on top of. See the general docstring
            of this class for more information.

            Additional notes:
            * If you specify this, the `parent_image` attribute will be ignored.
            * If you specify this, the image built from this Dockerfile needs
            to have ZenML installed.
        build_context_root: Build context root for the Docker build, only used
            when the `dockerfile` attribute is set. If this is left empty, the
            build context will only contain the Dockerfile.
        parent_image_build_config: Configuration for the parent image build.
        skip_build: If set to `True`, the parent image will be used directly to
            run the steps of your pipeline.
        prevent_build_reuse: Prevent the reuse of an existing build.
        target_repository: Name of the Docker repository to which the
            image should be pushed. This repository will be appended to the
            registry URI of the container registry of your stack and should
            therefore **not** include any registry. If not specified, the
            default repository name configured in the container registry
            stack component settings will be used.
        python_package_installer: The package installer to use for python
            packages.
        python_package_installer_args: Arguments to pass to the python package
            installer.
        replicate_local_python_environment: If not `None`, ZenML will use the
            specified method to generate a requirements file that replicates
            the packages installed in the currently running python environment.
            This requirements file will then be installed in the Docker image.
        requirements: Path to a requirements file or a list of required pip
            packages. During the image build, these requirements will be
            installed using pip. If you need to use a different tool to
            resolve and/or install your packages, please use a custom parent
            image or specify a custom `dockerfile`.
        required_integrations: List of ZenML integrations that should be
            installed. All requirements for the specified integrations will
            be installed inside the Docker image.
        required_hub_plugins: DEPRECATED/UNUSED.
        install_stack_requirements: If `True`, ZenML will automatically detect
            if components of your active stack are part of a ZenML integration
            and install the corresponding requirements and apt packages.
            If you set this to `False` or use custom components in your stack,
            you need to make sure these get installed by specifying them in
            the `requirements` and `apt_packages` attributes.
        apt_packages: APT packages to install inside the Docker image.
        environment: Dictionary of environment variables to set inside the
            Docker image.
        build_config: Configuration for the main image build.
        user: If not `None`, will set the user, make it owner of the `/app`
            directory which contains all the user code and run the container
            entrypoint as this user.
        allow_including_files_in_images: If `True`, code can be included in the
            Docker images if code download from a code repository or artifact
            store is disabled or not possible.
        allow_download_from_code_repository: If `True`, code can be downloaded
            from a code repository if possible.
        allow_download_from_artifact_store: If `True`, code can be downloaded
            from the artifact store.
        build_options: DEPRECATED, use parent_image_build_config.build_options
            instead.
        dockerignore: DEPRECATED, use build_config.dockerignore instead.
        copy_files: DEPRECATED/UNUSED.
        copy_global_config: DEPRECATED/UNUSED.
        source_files: DEPRECATED. Use allow_including_files_in_images,
            allow_download_from_code_repository and
            allow_download_from_artifact_store instead.
