"""Initialization of the ZenML Azure integration.

The Azure integration submodule provides a way to run ZenML pipelines in a cloud
environment. Specifically, it allows the use of cloud artifact stores,
and an `io` module to handle file operations on Azure Blob Storage.
The Azure Step Operator integration submodule provides a way to run ZenML steps
in AzureML.
