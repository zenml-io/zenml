    These settings adjust the compute resources that will be used by the
    pipeline execution.

    There are three possible use cases for this implementation:

        1. Serverless compute (default behavior):
            - The `mode` is set to `serverless` (default behavior).
            - All the other parameters become irrelevant and will throw a
            warning if set.

        2. Compute instance:
            - The `mode` is set to `compute-instance`.
            - In this case, users have to provide a `compute-name`.
                - If a compute instance exists with this name, this instance
                will be used and all the other parameters become irrelevant
                and will throw a warning if set.
                - If a compute instance does not already exist, ZenML will
                create it. You can use the parameters `compute_size` and
                `idle_type_before_shutdown_minutes` for this operation.

        3. Compute cluster:
            - The `mode` is set to `compute-cluster`.
            - In this case, users have to provide a `compute-name`.
                - If a compute cluster exists with this name, this instance
                will be used and all the other parameters become irrelevant
                and will throw a warning if set.
                - If a compute cluster does not already exist, ZenML will
                create it. You can set the additional parameters for this
                operation.
