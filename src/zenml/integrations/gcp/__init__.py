"""Initialization of the GCP ZenML integration.

The GCP integration submodule provides a way to run ZenML pipelines in a cloud
environment. Specifically, it allows the use of cloud artifact stores
and provides an `io` module to handle file operations on Google Cloud Storage
(GCS).

The Vertex AI integration submodule provides a way to run ZenML pipelines in a
Vertex AI environment.
