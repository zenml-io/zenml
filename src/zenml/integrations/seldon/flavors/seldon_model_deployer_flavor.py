        kubernetes_context: the Kubernetes context to use to contact the remote
            Seldon Core installation. If not specified, the current
            configuration is used. Depending on where the Seldon model deployer
            is being used, this can be either a locally active context or an
            in-cluster Kubernetes configuration (if running inside a pod).
            If the model deployer stack component is linked to a Kubernetes
            service connector, this field is ignored.
        kubernetes_namespace: the Kubernetes namespace where the Seldon Core
            deployment servers are provisioned and managed by ZenML. If not
            specified, the namespace set in the current configuration is used.
            Depending on where the Seldon model deployer is being used, this can
            be either the current namespace configured in the locally active
            context or the namespace in the context of which the pod is running
            (if running inside a pod).
            If the model deployer stack component is linked to a Kubernetes
            service connector, this field is mandatory.
        base_url: the base URL of the Kubernetes ingress used to expose the
            Seldon Core deployment servers.
        secret: the name of a ZenML secret containing the credentials used by
            Seldon Core storage initializers to authenticate to the Artifact
            Store (i.e. the storage backend where models are stored - see
            https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/servers/overview.html#handling-credentials).
        kubernetes_secret_name: the name of the Kubernetes secret containing
            the credentials used by Seldon Core storage initializers to
            authenticate to the Artifact Store (i.e. the storage backend where
            models are stored) - This is used when the secret is not managed by
            ZenML and is already present in the Kubernetes cluster.
