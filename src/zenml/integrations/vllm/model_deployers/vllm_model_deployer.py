          * if `replace` is False, calling this method will create a new vLLM

            parameters specified in the supplied vLLM service `config`.

            existing vLLM deployment service that is *equivalent* to the
            supplied configuration parameters. Two or more vLLM deployment
            services are considered equivalent if they have the same
            `pipeline_name`, `pipeline_step_name` and `model_name` configuration
            parameters. To put it differently, two vLLM deployment services
            are equivalent if they serve versions of the same model deployed by
            the same pipeline step. If an equivalent vLLM deployment is found,
            it will be updated in place to reflect the new configuration
            parameters.

        Callers should set `replace` to True if they want a continuous model
        deployment workflow that doesn't spin up a new vLLM deployment
        server for each new model version. If multiple equivalent vLLM
        deployment servers are found, one is selected at random to be updated

            timeout: the timeout in seconds to wait for the vLLM server

                to 0, the method will return immediately after the vLLM
