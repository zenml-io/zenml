"""Trace collectors let you collect and query traces from LLM observability platforms.

Trace collectors provide a unified interface to retrieve traces, spans, and sessions
from various LLM observability and tracing platforms. This enables monitoring,
debugging, and analysis of LLM application behavior in ZenML pipelines.
