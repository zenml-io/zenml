# 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it,
please report it right away by sending an
email to: [support@zenml.com](mailto:support@zenml.com?subject=Security%20Vulnerability%20Found). Please try to be as explicit as possible,
describing all the steps and example code to
reproduce the security issue.

We will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

Please refrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability as
this could potentially put our users at
risk! It's better to discuss privately and give us a chance to find a solution
first, to limit the potential impact
as much as possible.
