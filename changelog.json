    "title": "Dynamic pipelines are now available",
    "description": "Introduced Dynamic Pipelines as an experimental feature, allowing you to generate DAG structures at runtime using native Python control flow (loops, conditionals). Key capabilities include dynamic parallelization, Map/Reduce patterns over collections, and granular runtime configuration (inline vs. isolated). Supported on local, Kubernetes, AWS Sagemaker, and Google Cloud Vertex orchestrators. Dynamic pipelines can be run from snapshots with configurable parameters, and include improvements to Kubernetes orchestrator handling and step mapping operations that return future objects with an `unpack()` method for better control flow.",
