# Instructions: add rules here to skip reporting vulnerabilities that are not
# relevant to the runtime environment. The rules are based on the CVE ID.
# The CVE IDs can be found in the Trivy scan output.
#
# For every vulnerability that you want to skip, please include the following
# information:
# - Package: the name of the package reported by Trivy
# - Vulnerability: description of the vulnerability as reported by Trivy
# - Reference: a URL that provides more information about the vulnerability
# - Reason: why the vulnerability is not relevant to the runtime environment
#
# Example:
#
#  # Package: pypa-setuptools
#  # Vulnerability: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in
#  # package_index.py.
#  # Reference: https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2022-40897
#  # Reason: setuptools is not used in the runtime environment
#  CVE-2022-40897
#
# NOTE: vulnerabilities that haven't been fixed yet should not be ignored here
# because they are filtered out globally by Trivy. This file is only for
# vulnerabilities with available fixes.
#
