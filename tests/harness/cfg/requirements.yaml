# Software requirements and stack components that are needed
# by tests can be defined globally here and referenced by name in
# environments or per-test configurations or passed to pytest directly using the
# `--requirements` command line argument.
# 
# When referenced in an environment, the stack requirements are
# provisioned globally when the environment is setup. When referenced in a test,
# the requirements are interpreted as a test-specific requirements.
#
# The following fields can be configured in the test requirements:
#
# - name: The name of the configuration entry. This is needed to reference the
#   requirements in environments or test configurations.
# - mandatory: Setting this to true has the same effect as referencing it in
#   the environment's `mandatory_requirements` field.
# - integrations: A list of ZenML integrations that are required for the test to
#   run.
# - packages: A list of extra Python packages that are required for the test to
#   run. Each entry can be either a package name or a package name and version
#   specifier (e.g. `numpy==1.19.5`).
# - system_tools: A list of system_tools tools that are required for the test
#   to run. Each entry designates a binary that must be available in the system
#   path (e.g. `docker` or `kubectl`).
# - system_os: A list of operating systems that the test can run on. Valid
#   values are `linux`, `macos`, and `windows`.
# - stacks: Optional list of ZenML stack components that are required for the
#   test to run. Each entry contains the following fields:
#   - name: The name of the stack component. Mandatory for environment
#     requirements, ignored for test requirements.
#   - type (mandatory): The type of stack component required.
#   - flavor: The flavor of stack component required. If not
#     specified, any flavor of the given type is accepted. When specified, the
#     integration associated with the stack component flavor is implicitly added
#     to the test requirements. Mandatory for environment requirements, optional
#     for test requirements.
#   - external: If set to true, the stack component is assumed to be
#     already registered in the deployment and the test framework is not responsible for
#     creating it.
#   - containerized (optional): Whether the stack component uses (and builds)
#     container images or not (default: `false`). If this flag is set, the
#     framework will build the ZenML base container image locally upon
#     provisioning.
#   - configuration (optional): A dictionary of configuration options that must
#     be set for the stack component to be accepted. The values may reference
#     secrets that are defined in the test configuration or as environment
#     variables using the `{{SECRET_NAME_OR_ENV_VAR}}` syntax.
# - capabilities: A list of custom capabilities that the entry either provides
#   (when used or referenced in an environment) or requires (when used or
#   referenced in a test). Test capability requirements are compared against the
#   capabilities provided by the active environment and deployment to determine
#   if they can be run. When used or referenced in an environment, a `true`
#   value indicates that the environment supports the capability, while a
#   `false` value indicates that it doesn't. When used or referenced in a test
#   configuration , a `true` value indicates that the test requires the
#   capability to run, while a `false` value indicates that the test cannot run
#   if the capability is present.
#
# Note that the integrations, packages and system tools requirements are not
# installed automatically. The user is expected to install them in the host OS
# and/or current virtual environment. The test framework only checks for their
# presence and fails the environment setup (when used or referenced in
# environments) or skips the test (when used or referenced in tests) if they are
# not installed.
