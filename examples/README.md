## Examples

This `example` folder is dedicated to provide our users with some practical examples.

Here you can find a list with brief descriptions for each example:

- **aws_orchestrated**: Runs pipeline on an EC2 instance on `Amazon Web Services` as the orchestration backend.
- **cortex**: Tutorial on how to integrate with [Cortex](https://cortex.dev) to deploy your models.
- **batch_inference**: Run a offline batch inference job.
- **gan**: Tutorial on how to create and train a GAN model with a custom `TrainerStep` and `PreprocessorStep`.
- **gcp_dataflow_processing**: Showcases distributed preprocessing wth [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) as the processing backend.
- **gcp_gcaip_deployment**: Deploying a classifier with [Google Cloud AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform).
- **gcp_gcaip_training**: Training a classifier with [Google Cloud AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform).
- **gcp_gpu_orchestrated**: Training a classifier on an (optionally preemtible) cuda-enabled Google Cloud Platform virtual machine.
- **gcp_kubernetes_orchestrated**: Launches a kubernetes job on a kubernetes cluster.
- **gcp_orchestrated**: Runs pipeline on an (optionally preemtible) virtual machine on `Google Cloud Platform` as the orchestration backend.
- **pytorch**: Showcases PyTorch support.
- **pytorch_lightning**: Showcases [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) support.
- **quickstart**: The official quickstart tutorial.
- **scikit**: An example of using a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) trainer within ZenML.

Note: A lot of the examples are based on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). Extensions to other cloud providers like AWS and Azure will 
be released over time, but the interactions will be very similar. In fact, adding support for these can a great first pull 
request if you would to be a contributor to ZenML!
