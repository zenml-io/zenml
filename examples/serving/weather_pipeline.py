"""Weather Agent Pipeline with Simplified Capture Settings.

This pipeline demonstrates how to use ZenML's simplified capture settings
to control data logging and artifact persistence in a weather analysis service.

Key Capture Features:
- City names: Always captured (safe public data) - settings: {"inputs": {"city": "full"}}
- Weather data: Metadata-only (run tracking without payload exposure) - settings: {"inputs": {"weather_data": "metadata"}}
- LLM responses: Full capture with complete artifact persistence - settings: {"outputs": "full"}
- Pipeline default: Conservative metadata-only mode with custom redaction rules

This example shows the new simplified syntax for capture configuration with
fine-grained control over different data types.
