"""Weather Agent Pipeline for ZenML Serving with Run-Only Architecture.

This pipeline demonstrates ZenML's new run-only serving architecture that achieves
millisecond-class latency by automatically optimizing execution:

✅ Zero database writes
✅ Zero filesystem operations
✅ In-memory step output handoff
✅ Per-request parameter injection
✅ Multi-worker safe execution

Perfect for real-time inference and AI applications.
