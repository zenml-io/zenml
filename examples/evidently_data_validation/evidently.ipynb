    "# ZenML Data Validation With Evidently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Data profiling and validation is the process of examining and analyzing data to understand its characteristics, patterns, and quality. The goal of this process is to gain insight into the data, identify potential issues or errors, and ensure that the data is fit for its intended use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently is a Python package that provides tools for data profiling and validation. Evidently makes it easy to generate reports on your data, which can provide insights into its distribution, missing values, correlation, and other characteristics. These reports can be visualized and examined to better understand the data and identify any potential issues or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation involves testing the quality and consistency of the data. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as checking for missing values, duplicate records, and outliers, as well as testing the consistency and accuracy of the data. Evidently provides a suite of tests that can be used to evaluate the quality of the data, and provides scores and metrics for each test, as well as an overall data quality score.\n",
    "\n",
    "ZenML implements some standard steps that you can use to get reports or test your\n",
    "data with Evidently for quality and other purposes. These steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `EvidentlyReportStep` and `EvidentlySingleDatasetReportStep`: These steps generate\n",
    "a report for one or two given datasets. Similar to how you configure an Evidently\n",
    "Report, you can configure a list of metrics, metric presets or metrics generators\n",
    "for the step as parameters. The full list of metrics can be found\n",
    "[here](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reference/all-metrics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `EvidentlyTestStep` and `EvidentlySingleDatasetTestStep`: These step test one\n",
    "or two given datasets using various Evidently tests. Similar to how you configure\n",
    "an Evidently TestSuite, you can configure a list of tests, a test presets or\n",
    "test generators for the step as parameters. The full list of tests can be found\n",
    "[here](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/reference/all-tests/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run this notebook in an interactive environment, feel free to run\n",
    "it in a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/evidently_drift_detection/evidently.ipynb)\n",
    "or view it on [GitHub](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/evidently_drift_detection) directly."
