"""Agent Architecture Comparison Pipeline.

This pipeline implements the README example for comparing different agent architectures
on customer service queries. It demonstrates how to use ZenML to evaluate and compare
different AI approaches in a reproducible way.

This is the main entry point that imports from the modular structure.
