    Feature engineering pipeline.

    This is a pipeline that loads the data, processes it and splits
    it into train and test sets.

    Args:
        test_size: Size of holdout set for training 0.0..1.0
        drop_na: If `True` NA values will be removed from dataset
        normalize: If `True` dataset will be normalized with MinMaxScaler
        drop_columns: List of columns to drop from dataset
        target: Name of target column in dataset
        random_state: Random state to configure the data loader

    Returns:
        The processed datasets (dataset_trn, dataset_tst).
