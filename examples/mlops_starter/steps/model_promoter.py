    This is an example of a step that conditionally promotes a model. It takes
    in the accuracy of the model and the stage to promote the model to. If the
    accuracy is below 80%, the model is not promoted. If it is above 80%, the
    model is promoted to the stage indicated in the parameters. If there is
    already a model in the indicated stage, the model with the higher accuracy
    is promoted.

    Returns:
