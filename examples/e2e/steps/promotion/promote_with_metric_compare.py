    """Try to promote trained model.

    This is an example of a model promotion step. It gets precomputed
    metrics for 2 model version: latest and currently promoted to target environment
    (Production, Staging, etc) and compare than in order to define
    if newly trained model is performing better or not. If new model
    version is better by metric - it will get relevant
    tag, otherwise previously promoted model version will remain.

    If the latest version is the only one - it will get promoted automatically.

    This step is parameterized, which allows you to configure the step
    independently of the step code, before running it in a pipeline.
    In this example, the step can be configured to use precomputed model metrics
    and target environment stage for promotion.
    See the documentation for more information:

        https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/use-pipeline-step-parameters

        latest_metric: Recently trained model metric results.
