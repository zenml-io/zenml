    """Dataset splitter step.

    This is an example of a dataset splitter step that splits the data
    into train and test set before passing it to ML model.

    This step is parameterized, which allows you to configure the step
    independently of the step code, before running it in a pipeline.
    In this example, the step can be configured to use different test
    set sizes. See the documentation for more information:

        https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/use-pipeline-step-parameters

    Args:
        dataset: Dataset read from source.
        test_size: 0.0..1.0 defining portion of test set.

    Returns:
        The split dataset: dataset_trn, dataset_tst.
