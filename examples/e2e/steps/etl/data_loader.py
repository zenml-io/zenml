    """Dataset reader step.

    This is an example of a dataset reader step that load Breast Cancer dataset.

    This step is parameterized, which allows you to configure the step
    independently of the step code, before running it in a pipeline.
    In this example, the step can be configured with number of rows and logic
    to drop target column or not. See the documentation for more information:

        https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/use-pipeline-step-parameters

    Args:
        is_inference: If `True` subset will be returned and target column
            will be removed from dataset.
        random_state: Random state for sampling

    Returns:
        The dataset artifact as Pandas DataFrame and name of target column.
