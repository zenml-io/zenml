  description: e2e_use_case E2E Batch Use Case
  audience: All ZenML users
  use_cases: |
    The ZenML E2E project project demonstrates how the most important steps of 
    the ML Production Lifecycle can be implemented in a reusable way remaining 
    agnostic to the underlying infrastructure, and shows how to integrate them together 
    into pipelines for Training and Batch Inference purposes.
  ethics: No impact.
