        "\n",
        "Deploy to major cloud providers with minimal code changes\n",

        "* Connect directly to your existing infrastructure\n",
        "* Bridge the gap between ML and Ops teams\n",
        "* Gain deep insights into pipeline metadata via the ZenML Dashboard\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike traditional MLOps tools, ZenML offers unparalleled flexibility and control. It integrates seamlessly with your infrastructure, allowing both ML and Ops teams to collaborate effectively without compromising on their specific requirements.\n",
