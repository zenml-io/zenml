    "## 🌍 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this minimalistic MLOps project, designed as an ideal starting point for anyone looking to master the art of\n",
    "deploying Machine Learning workflows in production environments. This repository serves as a practical guide to bridge\n",
    "the gap between local development and cloud-scale operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's fast-paced AI landscape, the ability to seamlessly transition from experimentation to deployment is not just\n",
    "a convenience—it's a necessity. ZenML empowers you to break free from the constraints of local computing and\n",
    "harness the power of cloud infrastructure with minimal friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine developing your ML models on your laptop, then with just a few tweaks, watching them come to life on\n",
    "cutting-edge cloud platforms. This isn't just about scaling resources; it's about scaling your impact. You're not only\n",
    "optimizing your workflow but also setting your team up for the realities of modern ML engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our notebook demonstrates how simple this can be. You'll witness firsthand how code written for local execution\n",
    "can be effortlessly adapted to run on major cloud providers. This isn't just a technical exercise — it's a paradigm \n",
    "shift in how you approach ML development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ZenML is not just about deployment into compute. The ZenML Dashboard opens up a world of insights, allowing you\n",
    "to dive deep into the metadata of your runs. This level of observability is crucial for maintaining, debugging, \n",
    "and optimizing your ML pipelines in production environments with full reproducibility and auditability. The diagram \n",
    "below shows the steps that we will take to demonstrate this.\n",
