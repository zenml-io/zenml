    "# ZenML Quickstart: Bridging Local Development and Cloud Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository demonstrates how ZenML streamlines the transition of machine learning workflows from local environments to cloud-scale operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploy to major cloud providers with minimal code changes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connect directly to your existing infrastructure\n",
    "* Bridge the gap between ML and Ops teams\n",
    "* Gain deep insights into pipeline metadata via the ZenML Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional MLOps tools, ZenML offers unparalleled flexibility and control. It integrates seamlessly with your infrastructure, allowing both ML and Ops teams to collaborate effectively without compromising on their specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook guides you through adapting local code for cloud deployment, showcasing ZenML's ability to enhance workflow efficiency while maintaining reproducibility and auditability in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to unify your ML development and operations? Let's begin. The diagram below \n",
    "describes what we'll show you in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\".assets/Overview.png\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"Pipelines Overview\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We have done some of the experimenting for you already and created a simple finetuning pipeline for a text-to-text task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We will run this pipeline on your machine and a verify that everything works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Now we'll connect ZenML to your infrastructure and configure everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Finally, we are ready to run our code remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow along this notebook to understand how you can use ZenML to productionalize your ML workflows!"
