    """Try to promote trained model.

    This is an example of a model promotion step. It gets precomputed
    metrics for two model versions, the latest and currently promoted to target environment
    (Production, Staging, etc) and compare them in order to check
    if newly trained model is performing better or not. If new model
    version is better as per the metric - it will get relevant
    tag, otherwise previously promoted model version will remain.

    If the latest version is the only one, it will get promoted automatically.

    This step is parameterized, which allows you to configure the step
    independently of the step code, before running it in a pipeline.
    In this example, the step can be configured to use different input data.
    See the documentation for more information:

        https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/use-pipeline-step-parameters

    Args:
        latest_metrics: Recently trained model metrics results.
        current_metrics: Previously promoted model metrics results.
