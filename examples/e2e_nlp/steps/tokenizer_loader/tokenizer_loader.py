    """Tokenizer selection step.

    This step is responsible for selecting and initializing the tokenizer based
    on the model type. The tokenizer is a crucial component in Natural Language
    Processing tasks as it is responsible for converting the input text into a
    format that the model can understand.

    This step is parameterized, which allows you to configure the step independently
    of the step code, before running it in a pipeline. In this example, the step can
    be configured to use different types of tokenizers corresponding to different
    models such as 'bert', 'roberta', or 'distilbert'.

    For more information on how to configure steps in a pipeline, refer to the
    following documentation:

        https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/use-pipeline-step-parameters

    Args:
        lower_case: A boolean value indicating whether to convert the input text to
        lower case during tokenization.

    Returns:
        The initialized tokenizer.
